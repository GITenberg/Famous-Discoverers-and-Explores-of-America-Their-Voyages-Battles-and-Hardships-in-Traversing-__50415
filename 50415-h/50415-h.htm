<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>


<p class="pn2"><i>My Dear Boys</i>:</p>

<p>It has seemed fitting to include in the <span class="smcap">Famous
Leaders Series</span> this volume upon the discoverers and
explorers, not only of North America, but also of
Central and South America.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to include them all in a volume
of this character; but I have selected the most important,
and have omitted such men as Sebastian Cabot,
Jacques Cartier, Sir Francis Drake, Baffin, Verendrye,
Robert Gray, Lewis and Clark, Pike, Franklin, Frémont,
and many others.</p>

<p>This is no new subject. The lives and histories of
these discoverers have been written by many another;
but I have endeavored to bring before you a series of
pictures of some of the most noted of these men of
daring and grim determination, and, if I have succeeded
in painting the canvas with colors which are agreeable,
then, my dear boys, I shall feel that the moments occupied
in the preparation of these pages have been well
spent.</p>

<p class="pr8">Believe me,</p>

<h2 class="p4"><i>THE VOICE</i></h2>

<p class="ppind"><i>A voice came from the westward, it whispered a message clear,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>And the dripping fog banks parted as the clarion tones drew near;</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>It spoke of shores untrodden, and it sang of mountains bold,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of shimmering sands in distant lands which were covered with glittering gold.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>It sang of hemlock forests, where the moose roamed, and the bear,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Where the eider bred near the cascade’s head, and the lucivee had his lair.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>It praised the rushing water falls, it told of the salmon red,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Who swam in the spuming ripples by the rushing river’s head.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>It chanted its praise of the languorous days which lay ’neath the shimmering sun,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of the birch canoe and the Indian, too, who trapped in the forests dun.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Yea, it told of the bars of silver, and it whispered of emeralds green,</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of topaz, sapphire, and amethyst, which shone with a dazzling sheen.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of warriors red with feathered head, of buffalo, puma, and deer,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of the coral strand in a palm-tree land, and of dizzying mountains sheer.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>And the voice grew louder and louder, and it fell upon listening ears,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of the men who had heard strange music which was moistened with women’s tears.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Of the men who loved to wander, of the souls who cared to roam,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Whose bed was the hemlock’s branches, who rejoiced in the forest’s gloom.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Leif the Lucky, Magellan, deLeon and Cortés bold,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Cartier, Drake, and Franklin; Pizarro and Baffin, old;</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Shackleton, Hudson, Roosevelt; brave Peary and gay Champlain,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Frémont, Lewis, Balboa; Verendrye, and the Cabots twain;</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>’Twas the voice that called them onward, ’twas the voice that is calling still,</i></p>

<p class="ppind"><span class="smcap">And the voice will call ’till the end of it all, and the voice has a conquering will.</span></p>

<h2>LEIF ERICSON:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FIRST EUROPEAN TO EXPLORE, AND
SETTLE IN, AMERICA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">ON the shore of a great fiord, or estuary of the
sea, in the far northern country of Greenland,
stood a little boy. He was sturdy-limbed,
blue-eyed, flaxen-haired, and he was looking out across
the water at a great high-prowed Viking ship which
lay bobbing upon the waves.</p>

<p>He stood there thinking,&mdash;thinking, until, as he
gazed enraptured upon the scene before him, a tall,
bearded Norwegian came up behind him. He smiled
upon the little boy, and, laying his hand upon his head,
said:</p>

<p>“Little one, what are you dreaming about?”</p>

<p>The youthful Norwegian looked around and also
smiled.</p>

<p>“Good Lothair,” he answered, “I am thinking of
the time when I shall be able to sail far to the westward,
with the older Vikings, and can have adventures
of mine own.”</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, ha, that time will not be far distant,” said
he, benignly. “You will wax tough and sinewy in
this bracing air and by sailing in these blue fiords.
And then, some day, one of the Vikings will want a
stout fellow to man an oar. He will call upon Leif,
little Leif. And I’ll warrant that little Leif will then
be ready.”</p>

<p>“I will be.”</p>

<p>“And would you go far to the westward, to the
land of the setting sun?”</p>

<p>“Even so.”</p>

<p>“And would you be willing to risk life and limb
amidst ice and snow?”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to do it.”</p>

<p>Lothair laughed loud and long.</p>

<p>“You are a true Viking, my boy. You are, indeed,
one of those whom Thor has smiled upon and whom the
Valkyrias would love to assist in battle. Keep up your
spirit, and, some day, you may be famous,&mdash;who
knows?”</p>

<p>So saying he walked away, still laughing softly to
himself.</p>

<p>And the little boy still kept on thinking, thinking,
and looking out upon the great, blue sea which seemed
to beckon to him, to nod to him, and to sigh: “Come
on! Come on! I have marvelous things to reveal to
you, little boy.”</p>

<p>The youthful Viking turned around, went back to
his home, and kept on working and sailing, and fishing,
and playing, until a time came when he had waxed
great in both strength and in stature, and, as he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at himself in the polished surface of his shield he said:
“Ah! Now, indeed, I am a true Viking. I am ready
for great things.”</p>

<p>This little boy was the son of Eric the Red, a strong
man, and a bad man, also. Eric’s father lived in Iceland,
whither he had been forced to fly from Norway,
for he had killed a man there and he would himself
have been killed, had he not jumped into a boat,
rowed to a Viking ship, and sailed to the westward.
And Eric the Red seems to have inherited the traits of
his father, for he, too, killed another. He had lent
some of his furniture to a neighbor who would not restore
it. Eric, therefore, carried off his goods and the
other pursued him. They met, and hot words passed;
so they had a struggle and Eric killed the fellow. He
was thus made an outlaw, so he went sailing away to
find some place where he could live in peace, far from
his brother Vikings. He found a land, where he settled,&mdash;and
called it Greenland, for, said he, “other
Vikings will come here and settle, also, if I give this
place a good name.”</p>

<p>Eric the Red, had two children, of whom one was
called Thorstein, and the other, Leif. The first developed
into a thin youth with black hair and a sallow
complexion, but the second was rosy-cheeked, fair-haired,
blue-eyed, and sturdy-limbed. He was, in fact,
the little boy to whom Lothair spoke as he stood upon
the banks of the fiord, gazing far into the distance,
determined, some day, to sail towards the West where
he was certain that adventure and treasure, too, perhaps,
were waiting for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the men who accompanied Eric, the murderer,
to Greenland was named Herjulf. This bold and daring
adventurer had a son named Bjarni, who roved the
seas over, in search of adventure, for many, many years.
Finally, in 986, he came home to Iceland in order to
drink the Yuletide ale with his father. Finding that
his parent had gone away, he weighed anchor and
started after him to Greenland, but he encountered
foggy weather, and thus sailed for many days by guess
work, without seeing either the sun or the stars. When,
at length, he sighted land, it was a shore without mountains.
He saw, through the misty murk, only a small
height covered with dense woods. So, without stopping
in order to make explorations, he turned his
prow to the north and kept on. He knew that this
was not Greenland, and, so we may think it strange
that he did not stop to examine the rugged coastline.</p>

<p>The sky was now fair and a brisk breeze was astern,
so, after scudding along for nine or ten days, Bjarni
saw the icy crags of Greenland looming up before him,
and, after some further searching, found his way to
his father’s house. He had more than once sighted
a heavily timbered shore-line, to the west, while steering
for home, and, when he told of it, great curiosity
was excited amongst the Norsemen.</p>

<p>Little Leif had now grown to be a man of size and
strength. He had made many a journey to Norway,
and, when there, in the year 998, found that Roman
missionary priests were preaching up and down the
land, and had converted the King, Olaf Tryggbesson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
who had formerly worshiped the Gods Thor and Odin.
Leif, himself, became a Christian and was baptized,
so, when he returned to Greenland, he took several
priests with him, who converted many of the people.
Old Eric the Red, however, preferred to worship in the
way of his fathers, and continued to believe in the
mystical Valhalla, or hall of departed spirits, where the
dead Vikings were supposed to drink huge cups of ale
while feasting with their gods.</p>

<p>Upon a bright, warm day in the year 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
a great Viking ship lay calmly upon the waters of the
bay before the town of Bratthalid in Greenland, and on
shore all was bustle and confusion. Leif Ericson, in
fact, had determined to sail far to the westward, even
as he had dreamed of doing when a little boy; and so,
with thirty staunch adventurers, he was preparing to
load his ship with sufficient provisions to last for the
journey to that strange country of which Bjarni had
brought news. It took several weeks to gather provisions
and men, but at length everything was ready.
The sail was hoisted, the great oaken oars were dipped
into the water, and the sharp bow of the Viking ship
was turned toward the open sea. “Huzzah! Huzzah!”
shouted the Norsemen. “Huzzah!”</p>

<p>The Viking ship, which had a huge dragon’s head at
the prow, was such a tiny affair, when compared with
the massive ocean liners of to-day, that one can well
imagine how she must have been tossed about by the
great, surging waves; but she kept on and on, ever steering
westward, until a land was discovered which seemed
to be filled with flat stones, so they called it Helluland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or flat-stone land. This was the Newfoundland of our
maps, to-day.</p>

<p>Leaving this behind them, the Vikings kept on steering
southward and westward, until they saw a low-lying
and heavily wooded shore. This was Nova
Scotia, and they coasted along it, for many days, occasionally
coming to anchor in one of the deep bays,
and heaving overboard their fishing lines, so as to catch
some of the many fish which seemed to abound in these
waters.</p>

<p>They sailed on towards the south, and at last reached
a place where a beautiful river flowed through a sort
of an inland lake into the sea. Many islands were
near the mouth of this stream, and, as salmon seemed
to abound in the waters of this blue and clear-flowing
estuary of the Atlantic, Leif decided that this was a
good place in which to spend the winter. So down
went the anchor, the Viking ship was moored near the
shore, and the men scrambled to the beach in order to
erect huts in which to spend the cold season. Thus
the dream of the little boy, as he had stood upon the
shore of Greenland, years before, had come true,
and Leif had reached a new world, to which he
had been led by his daring and his love of adventure.</p>

<p>You see, that, although it was long supposed that
Columbus was the first white man from Europe to ever
set his foot upon the shore of America, such is not the
case.</p>

<p>The real discoverer of America, of whom we have
any definite record, was Bjarni, the son of Herjulf,
who, in the midst of fog and murk, coasted along the
shore of Nova Scotia in 986 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>And the first European to make a settlement upon
the shores of the new world was Leif Ericson, who
sailed into that blue, salmon-filled river which flows
“through a lake into the sea.” So, if you look along
the coast of New England, and try to find a river which
answers this description, you will, I think, find but one.
This is the river Charles, which, emptying into the
Charles River Basin&mdash;a huge lake, if you wish&mdash;flows
into the blue Atlantic. And, if you search the
shore upon the Cambridge side near the hospital, you
will find, to-day, the cellars of four houses,&mdash;the houses,
no doubt, which Leif and his men erected in the year
1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>The Vikings built their huts, caught many salmon,
and journeyed inland, where they found a profusion
of wild grapes, so many, in fact, that they dried a great
mass of them, loaded them into the hold, and called
this land Vinland, the Good. They also found a race
of people living in this country, who were ferocious in
aspect, with ugly hair, big eyes, and broad cheeks.
They were clad in the skins of the beaver, the lynx and
the fox, and their weapons were bows and arrows,
slings, and stone hatchets. As they screeched dismally
when about to attack in battle, the Vikings called them
Skraelings, or Screechers. It is apparent that the
Skraelings were more like the Esquimaux, than like the
Indians found by Columbus.</p>

<p>The Vikings spent a peaceful winter in Vinland and
had no difficulty with the Skraelings, who left them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
alone. The Norsemen felled a great many trees and
loaded their ship with lumber, with dried fish and
grapes. Spring at last came and the ice and snow
melted in the deep forests, the gray geese began to fly
northward, and the robins chanted a melodious welcome
from the budding thickets. The followers of Leif
deserted their huts, clambered aboard their low-lying
vessel, and, singing a song of thanksgiving, turned her
prow towards the blue Atlantic. They coasted past
the islands at the harbor-mouth, and, driven by a stout
breeze, were soon careening over the waves upon their
journey to Greenland.</p>

<p>But adventures were not entirely over, for, upon the
way home, a dark spot appeared upon the horizon, and,
upon sailing up to it, Leif and his seamen discovered
a boat-load of sailors. These poor fellows had been
out in a large vessel, but she had foundered, and had
gone to the bottom in a squall. The castaways were
rescued, were taken aboard the home-going Viking
ship, and were carried along to Bratthalid, where Leif
and his followers received a royal welcome, and great
interest was taken in the story of their adventures.
Leif was christened Leif the Lucky, and by that name
he was to be known forever afterwards.</p>

<p>The daring navigator never again sailed to the pine-clad
coast of Vinland, but other Norsemen made the
journey and some left their bones to bleach upon the
shores of New England. Thus in 1002, when Eric
the Red died, and Leif the Lucky succeeded to his
Earldom, Thorstein (Leif’s brother) decided to explore
the new-found country. So, with thirty or more men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he sailed to the westward, found the huts which the
first adventurers had erected, and had the pleasure of
spending the winter there. These voyagers stayed here
for several years, for, in the Spring of 1004, while some
of the party were exploring, the ship was driven ashore
in a storm, near a ness, or cape. They put a new keel
into their damaged vessel and stuck the old one into
the sand, calling the place Kjalarness, or Keel Cape.
The cape was undoubtedly near the end of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>Thorstein was subsequently slain in a battle with the
Skraelings, but his men returned to Greenland, bringing
lumber, dried fish, and many tales of this wonderful
country; so that other Vikings longed to go and
explore. Thus, in the summer of 1011, two ships set
sail for Vinland, one with Leif’s brother and sister,
Thorwald and Freydis, and a crew of thirty men; the
other with two brothers, Helgi and Finnibogi, and a
crew of thirty-five. There were also a number of
women.</p>

<p>Helgi and Finnibogi were the first to arrive at the
huts which Leif had constructed, and had taken possession
of them, when Freydis, arriving soon afterwards,
ordered them to leave. Bad blood arose, and
Freydis one day complained that Helgi had given her
evil words and had struck her. She told Thorwald that
he should avenge this insult, and taunted him so mercilessly,
that, unable to bear her jeering words any
longer, he was aroused to a deed of blood. Surrounded
by his followers, he made a night attack upon the huts
of Helgi and Finnibogi, seized and bound all the occupants,
and killed them with cold steel. The peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
shores of the river Charles witnessed such a murder
as has never occurred again.</p>

<p>In 1012 the survivors sailed for Greenland in the
vessel of the murdered brothers, which was the larger
of the two. The evil woman, Freydis, who had caused
all this trouble, pretended that the other party had
been left in Vinland, and that ships had merely been
exchanged. She threatened her men, that, if any told
on her, they would be murdered, but words were let fall
which came to the ears of Leif the Lucky. Three of
those who had just returned were put to the torture,
until they told the whole story of murder and death
in the peaceful country of Vinland.</p>

<p>Leif was greatly affected by the news, but said with
great show of magnanimity: “I have no heart to punish
my wicked sister Freydis as she deserves. But this
I do say to Freydis and Thorwald,&mdash;that their posterity
will never thrive.”</p>

<p>“And”&mdash;says an old Viking&mdash;“so it went that no
one thought anything but evil of them from that time
on.”</p>

<p>This is the last that we hear of Leif the Lucky.
That little rosy-cheeked boy, who dreamed that one
day he would be a great adventurer, had accomplished
his purpose. He had found a new country, he had
lived to see it explored by other Vikings, and he had
opened the eyes of Europeans to the fact that, far away
there was a land which was richer in furs and in timber
than anything which they had about them.</p>

<p>The citizens of Boston, Massachusetts, have erected
a bronze statue to this navigator, upon Commonwealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Avenue; where, with hand shading his keen eyes, the
staunch Norwegian is going out upon the Charles
River;&mdash;that river, upon the banks of which in the
year 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, he and his followers spent a peaceful
winter in the land of the Skraelings, the beaver, the
bear, and the pink-fleshed salmon. Skoal, then, to Leif
the Lucky! And remember that it was he, and not
Columbus, who first trod upon the shores of America
as an adventurer from the European world.</p>

A NEW CONTINENT TO THE WORLD.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1436-1506)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE good and genial friar Juan Perez was working,
one day, in front of the convent of La
Rabida, which had been dedicated to Santa
Maria de Rabida, near the pleasant city of Palos, in
Spain. It was a lonely place, built upon beetling cliffs
which overhung the blue ocean. The friar, with his
brown cassock tucked up around his fat legs, was busily
engaged in hoeing some beans, when he saw a man
standing at the little wicket gate which was between
himself and the roadway. The man was thin, care-worn,
and cadaverous-looking. His hair was quite
gray and he held a small boy by the hand.</p>

<p>“Kind priest,” said he, “I am faint with hunger.”</p>

<p>The good friar dropped his hoe and stood there smiling;
for he had a warm heart, and the little boy, whom
the stranger held by the hand, was very wistful.</p>

<p>“In God’s name, my poor fellow,” said Juan Perez,
“come into the convent with me, and I will give you all
that you wish, for I see that you are faint with hunger.
And the little boy is surely very ill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>So the white-haired man and the little boy went into
the convent of Santa Maria de Rabida, and there the
priest fell into a long conversation with this traveler.
He found out that the wanderer was named Christopher
Columbus and that he had been born in Genoa, in Italy.
The little boy was his son, Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The priest was a man of great learning and had been
confessor to the Queen of Spain. He soon perceived
that this Christopher Columbus was a man of considerable
learning, also, and found out that he had been a
sailor ever since he had been a boy of fourteen.
Charmed and delighted with the conversation of this
penniless mariner, he asked him to remain as a guest
at the convent, for he saw that, within the lean body of
this white-haired sailor, burned a spirit of adventure
which was like a beacon light.</p>

<p>“Had I the money, the ships, and the men,” said
Columbus, “I could discover a new country lying far
to the west. But, you see, I am a pauper.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the good priest. “But I have powerful
friends who have both money and ships. These
will doubtless help you in your contemplated voyage.
Stay with me for a few days. I will call them hither,
so that you can discuss this matter with them.”</p>

<p>Columbus was glad to have this prelate listen to his
schemes for sailing far to the westward, for he had
been endeavoring, for a long time, to get some one to
give him the necessary financial assistance, so that he
could fit out ships both with provisions and with men.
In a day or two a physician arrived. He was a learned
fellow, and his name was Garcia Fernandez. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
accompanied by a wealthy navigator, called Martin
Alonzo Pinzon, who listened to the schemes of Columbus
with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I, myself, will lend you money for this voyage
westward,” said he. “And I will go in person upon
this hazardous undertaking.”</p>

<p>The good priest, Juan Perez, had become most enthusiastic
over the scheme.</p>

<p>“Wait until I write to our gracious Queen Isabella,”
said he. “She, I know, will aid you in your contemplated
journey. Be of good cheer, for she is the
best of sovereigns, and cannot allow a Frenchman to
have the honor of any discoveries in the West.”</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus was quite willing to have this
done, for he was sure that, could he but gain access
to the ear of the great Queen, she, herself would see the
righteousness of his cause and aid and abet in that
which filled him with zeal and enthusiasm. So he
waited patiently at the convent while a letter was dispatched
to the kind-hearted Isabella, carried to the
court by one Sebastian Rodriguez, a pilot of Lepe,
and a man of considerable prominence. The Queen
was at the military camp of Santa Fé, where she was
directing her troops against the city of Granada, which
was held by the Moors.</p>

<p>Fourteen days went by, and, at last, Rodriquez returned
to the heights of Palos.</p>

<p>“The Queen is much interested in your mariner
friend, Columbus,” said he to Juan Perez. “She
wishes greatly to add to the glory of Spain, and requests
that you allow this sailor to travel to her military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
camp. But first she wishes to talk with you, good
priest.”</p>

<p>The friar was delighted. Quickly saddling his mule,
he was soon upon his way to Santa Fé, where he was
received with kindness and consideration. The Queen
had a friend and companion called the Marchioness
Moya who urged her to give aid to Columbus and thus
bring much renown and glory both to herself and Spain.
“This fellow has a great idea,” she said. “Surely
you will allow him, in the name of Spain, to find out
what lies far to the westward.”</p>

<p>Isabella was feeling particularly happy, just then,
for her troops had nearly captured the city of Granada
and the hated Moors were about to be driven from the
soil of Spain. So she gave a great deal of money to
the priest from Palos, in order that Christopher Columbus
could buy a mule and sufficient clothing to appear
at court. With smiles of satisfaction the good friar
returned to the convent at La Rabida and the first link
in the chain which led to the discovery of the West
Indies by those of white complexion, had been forged.</p>

<p>The time had come when the schemes of western exploration,
which for years had lain dormant in the
breast of this penniless man from Genoa, were about to
be put into execution. Columbus was now light-hearted,
even merry, and, leaving his little son to the
care of the good monks of Palos, he mounted a mule
and journeyed to Santa Fé, accompanied by his friend
Juan Perez.</p>

<p>It was a propitious moment. The Moorish leader
had just handed over the keys of the city of Granada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to Queen Isabella, who, mounted upon her horse and
surrounded by a retinue of ladies-in-waiting and courtiers,
joyfully received the keys, as evidence that the
Moors were at last driven from the soil of Spain. Columbus
soon was admitted to her presence and there
told of his desire to sail westward toward the setting
sun.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “if this voyage is a success, I must
be made Admiral and Viceroy over the countries which
I discover, and must also receive one-tenth of the revenues
which come from these lands, either from trade
or from agriculture.”</p>

<p>These terms did not suit the Queen’s counselors.</p>

<p>“It would be degrading to exalt an ordinary man to
such high position,” said Talavera, the Queen’s foremost
advisor. “The demands of this threadbare navigator
are absurd.”</p>

<p>More moderate terms were offered to Columbus, but
he declined them.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Your Majesty,” said he. “I will go to
France, where the King will perhaps give me more advantageous
offerings than you care to present.”</p>

<p>So the good man mounted his mule&mdash;the very one
which the Queen had presented him with&mdash;but he
did not seem to mind using it, and, turning his back
on Santa Fé, and the convent of La Rabida, he started
for the Pyrenees Mountains in order to journey to
France.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone the Queen began to feel
sorry that she had allowed him to depart. Her friends
gathered around her and had a good deal to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“What an opportunity you are losing to enhance
the glory of Spain,” said several. “What a chance to
make your own name forever great. If I were you,
I would call this navigator back to court before he
arrives upon the soil of France.”</p>

<p>Her husband, King Ferdinand, looked coldly upon the
project, for his treasury had been exhausted by the
fighting with the Moors and he did not wish to spend
any more money, just then. But the Queen had many
jewels which she could pledge in order to raise money
for ships and for supplies.</p>

<p>“Ferdinand,” said she to her husband, “if you
do not care to undertake this enterprise for the glory
of the crown of Castile, I myself, will do so, and I will
give all of my jewels as security for a loan to the navigator
Columbus.”</p>

<p>A courier was sent post haste after the sailor from
Genoa, who was then ambling along upon his mule
and was crossing the bridge of Pinos, some six miles
from Granada.</p>

<p>“The Queen has changed her mind towards you,”
said the courier who had been sent to find the poor
navigator. “Come back! You will now have funds
with which to go upon your journey.”</p>

<p>Columbus hesitated a moment, for he feared that
this was a lie, but, convinced of the truth of the statement,
he turned about and whipped up his mule. They
trotted along joyfully towards Santa Fé.</p>

<p>The Queen was now in a pleasant humor. Columbus
was given all that he had asked for, but he was required
to bear one-eighth of the expense of the journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Papers to this effect were drawn up and signed on April
the seventeenth, 1492, and, a month later, the joyful
navigator set out for Palos in order to get ready the
ships and provisions for the long-hoped-for voyage of
discovery.</p>

<p>By the terms of the agreement between himself and
the King and Queen he was to be called Viceroy and
Governor of the new provinces which he wished to
conquer in the rich territories of Asia, the country
which he thought to be in the far west. He was to
receive one-tenth of the pearls, precious stones, gold,
silver, spices, and merchandise of whatever kind, which
might be taken by his followers in the kingdoms which
he expected to take possession of. Good terms these!
Let us see how he fared!</p>

<p>Three caravels were now equipped for the journey
at the port of Palos. It was difficult to find sailors to
man them with. All were frightened at the enterprise
and shuddered when they thought of a long sail into
the unknown West. But the King said that he would
pardon all those who had criminal charges hanging
over them, should they join the expedition. In this
way a sufficient number of sailors were secured.</p>

<p>The three ships were called the <i>Gallega</i>, the <i>Pinta</i>,
and the <i>Nina</i>. The first was to be the flagship of Columbus,
so he changed her name to the <i>Santa Maria</i>, as
he was of a religious turn of mind. The <i>Pinta</i> was
commanded by Martin Pinzon, and the <i>Nina</i> by his two
brothers, Francis and Vincent.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 30th, 1492, the caravels headed
out to sea and started upon this voyage of discovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
One hundred and twenty sailors had been secured, most
of them with criminal records, so it was not to be
expected that the Admiral, as Columbus was now called,
would have an easy time with them. Some, in fact,
were so anxious not to go that they purposely unshipped
the rudder of the <i>Pinta</i>, when only a day from port,
and the vessel had to be steered for the Canary Isles
in order to repair the damage. Finally, after a three
weeks’ delay, during which another rudder was made,
the expedition again hoisted canvas and headed for
the blue horizon of the west. The hearts of the Spanish
sailors now failed them and many cried like little children,
for they were fearful of what lay before them;
some, indeed, even thinking that they would come to a
great hole and fall in. As for Columbus, he tried to
comfort them with the prospect of gold and precious
stones in India and Cathay which he was sure that
they would discover.</p>

<p>“On, on, my men,” said he. “On, and let us all be
enriched by the treasures which we will soon come
upon!”</p>

<p>But the ignorant sailors were constantly anxious and
distrustful.</p>

<p>The bellying sails carried the three caravels ever to
the westward. They sailed through vast masses of sea-weed
on which small fish and crabs were hanging, and
the sailors feared that they would be stranded upon this
mass of vegetation. But when they threw lines into
the water these did not touch the bottom, so they knew
that they could go forward. The three vessels, in fact,
were plowing through the Sargossa Sea, eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
miles from the Canary Isles. This is a mass of tangled
sea-weed over two miles in depth, so it is no wonder
that the lines did not touch anything when they let
them down.</p>

<p>Now birds began to fly around the caravels, such as
gannets and sea-swallows.</p>

<p>“Land must surely be near,” cried many. “We
have now been six weeks upon the water and Asia must
certainly be before us.”</p>

<p>But, in spite of the birds and the floating sea-weed,
the boats kept on and on and still no land came to view.</p>

<p>Columbus, himself, never lost his confidence in the
ultimate success of the journey.</p>

<p>“My men,” said he, “land will eventually be sighted.
You must bolster up your hearts and have great courage,
for we will soon view the coast of Asia, where lives
the mighty Khan.”</p>

<p>And, each evening, he made the sailors chant a hymn
to the Virgin. Cheered by the words of this heroic
man, the Spaniards gained renewed hope and eagerly
scanned the horizon for some signs of palm trees or
tropic vegetation.</p>

<p>Before the expedition had set out, King Ferdinand
had promised a reward of 10,000 maravédis, or 400
pounds sterling ($2,000), to the sailor who first discovered
land. So, do you wonder that the mariners
eagerly scanned the blue distance for a dark line of
earth!</p>

<p>As the ships drowsed along with a gentle easterly
wind in their rear, numerous large birds, petrels, man-of-war
birds and damiers, flying in couples, were a sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that land must certainly be near, for otherwise how
could these feathered sea-farers breed and lay their
eggs? On, on, the mariners drifted, the sailors eager,
depressed, even mutinous, but the courage of Columbus
never wavered.</p>

<p>The month of October had now arrived and the Admiral
announced to his crews that the ships had traveled
1,272 miles to the westward. In reality, they had
sailed 2,100 miles; but Columbus hid the truth from
his followers, for he knew them to be on the point of
mutiny, and, should they learn how far they were from
home, they would wish to return. On October the
seventh the crews were much excited by hearing several
musketry discharges from the <i>Nina</i>, the commander
of which thought that he had discovered land.
But this was an illusion; what he took to be land was
but a patch of sea-weed, bobbing on the glassy waves.</p>

<p>A number of parroquets went flying by in a southwesterly
direction, and, thinking that they were doubtless
winging their way towards their homes, the Admiral
was requested to steer more towards the south.
This he did, and it is well that he so traveled, for, had
the vessels kept due westward, they would doubtless
have run aground upon the great Bahama Bank and
would have been destroyed.</p>

<p>But why did not land appear?</p>

<p>Each evening the sun dipped down behind an interminable
horizon of water. Sea-weed floated past,
birds flew around upon every side, and still no land
came to view. The Spaniards began to murmur loudly
against Columbus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is a Genoese, a foreigner,” said some. “What
does he care for Spaniards! He has enticed us from
our own country only to drown us all. One thrust of
a poniard and he will be out of the way forever!”</p>

<p>The Admiral heard of these remarks and knew that
his sailors plotted his destruction, but his spirit never
faltered, and, as the men still worked the ships, he kept
courageously onward.</p>

<p>The eleventh of October had now come, and, as the
bold navigator was looking over the side of the <i>Santa
Maria</i>, he noticed a reed, still green, floating upon the
top of a wave. His heart beat faster, for he realized
that land must certainly be in the offing. Almost at
the same time the men on board the <i>Nina</i> perceived
the branch of a thorny tree, covered with blossoms,
which bobbed upon the sprawling waves. All rejoiced
exceedingly, for they knew that the coast of some
strange country must be near. Night fell over the
sea, and Columbus took up his position on the foremost
part of his vessel, where he could watch until morning.
About ten o’clock he thought that he saw a light in
the distance and called to a sailor, Pedro Guitierrez,
a chamberlain in the King’s service, who confirmed it.
Once or twice, after this, the Admiral again saw the
light, which looked as if some person were carrying
a flambeau on shore, or in a boat, tossed by the waves.</p>

<p>Columbus spent a restless night. When morning
broke, a sailor called Rodrigo de Triana, saw land from
the deck of the <i>Pinta</i>, and a thrill of joy and thanksgiving
ran through every heart. It was only two miles
away, and the vessels quickly headed towards the low-lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
shore. Every one eagerly crowded forward, with
shouts and cries of joy, as the three caravels drew nearer
and nearer to the sandy beach. The vessels anchored,
and, crowding into the boats, Columbus, with his followers,
rowed towards the breaking combers. All were
eager to set foot upon the new-found territory.</p>

<p>Columbus had on a scarlet coat; and in one hand he
held a cross, in the other a sword. When he reached
the beach he knelt upon one knee and kissed the soil,
while one of his followers held over his head the royal
banner of gold, embroidered with crowns and with
an F and I, the initials of Kind Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella. He gave thanks to God; while all his crew
of malcontents joined him in singing the Te Deum.
His sailors gathered about him, embracing him with
fervor, and begging his forgiveness for their mutinous
spirit.</p>

<p>At this moment some naked savages appeared from
behind the tropic foliage and came timidly towards the
Spaniards. None of the men appeared to be over
thirty years of age, and the women, too, were young.
They were well made, their figures handsome, and their
faces agreeable. Their hair, as coarse as the tail of
a horse, hung down in front as far as their eyebrows,
while behind it formed a long mass which was apparently
never cut.</p>

<p>As they approached, the Spaniards greeted them
kindly, and, when the voyageurs showed them their
swords, the poor natives seized them in their hands so
that they cut their fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards roamed about for some time, glad
indeed to stretch their legs, and then jumped into their
long boats, in order to go back to the ships. Several
of the natives plunged into the water and swam after
them, crying out with apparent pleasure. Next day
they came in crowds around the vessels, paddling themselves
in enormous canoes shaped from the trunks of
trees and guided by means of broad paddles, like a
snow shovel. Several of the islanders wore little plates
of gold hanging from their nostrils, which interested
the Spaniards more than anything else. “Where did
you get this?” they signaled to the chattering Indians.
The natives pointed towards the south, when they understood
what the mariners wished to know, and this
made the voyageurs eager to get away, for gold was
ever that which has lured the Spaniard onward.</p>

<p>Columbus named the island San Salvador, and believed
that he had arrived upon the coast of Asia. The
place was beautiful. Gray and yellow parroquets chattered
and screamed from the trees, and brilliant tropic
birds fluttered before them, as the Spaniards explored
the interior. A small lake was in the center of the
island, but there was no sign of gold or of gold mines.
So the voyageurs turned away, disgusted, and determined
to sail southward where the natives told them was
a mighty monarch who possessed great vessels of gold,
and immense riches.</p>

<p>The next morning, at day-break, Columbus gave orders
to have the ships prepared for sea and all set sail
towards the south, coasting along the western side of
the island, while the natives, running down to the
shore, offered the Spaniards water and cassava bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
made from the root of a plant called the “yucca.”
The Admiral landed upon the coast at different points
and carried off some of the natives, so that he might
exhibit them in Spain. Poor, ignorant islanders!
Little did they guess that soon the white-skinned strangers
would tear them from their country in order to
sell them as slaves.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were really among the West Indies;
but Columbus still had the idea that he was near
China, the home of the mighty Khan, stories of whose
wealth and possessions had already been brought to
Spain. So, after the three caravels had left the island
of Cuba, two emissaries were dispatched into the interior
in order to take presents to the Khan. They
soon returned, telling of the peaceful natives, beautiful
groves of palm trees, but of no signs of the Asiatic
potentate. They reported that both the native men
and women smoked tobacco by means of a forked pipe,
and that they had cotton houses made in the form of
tents.</p>

<p>The crews now began to grow restless. They had
come to find Asia or India, where were great hoards
of gold. Instead of this they had found merely some
tropic islands, populated by a race of naked savages
who had no great treasures and knew nothing of gold
mines. The Admiral sailed onward and kept discovering
other islands, in all of which he found many articles
of gold, but no particularly great city or town
with riches and treasure. And there were no signs of
the mighty Khan of Asia.</p>

<p>While exploring the coast of an island called Hayti,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a young chief visited the caravels, attended by two
hundred subjects. He spoke little, but gave the Admiral
a curious belt and two pieces of gold, for which
Columbus, in return, presented him with a piece of
cloth, several amber beads, colored shoes, and a flask
of orange water. In the evening the native was sent
on shore with great ceremony and a salute was fired
in his honor, which both surprised and interested him.</p>

<p>A short time after this a still greater chief, named
Guacanagari, sent a messenger to the Admiral requesting
him to come to his part of the island. The ships
were therefore turned in the direction of this chief’s
home, and had sailed within a mile of his residence,
when the <i>Santa Maria</i> ran upon a sand bank and quickly
went to pieces. When news of this was brought to the
native ruler, he sent his followers to unload the vessel
and guard the contents, and his family to cheer the
Spanish navigator and to assure him that everything
which he possessed was at his disposal. All of the
Spaniards went on board the <i>Nina</i> and were later entertained
by the prince. So well, indeed, did Columbus
like this island that he determined to erect a fort upon
the coast, and to leave there a certain number of men
with a year’s provisions of bread, wine, and seed, also
the long boat of the <i>Santa Maria</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Spaniards were now eager
to return to Spain, for, although they had discovered
a new territory, they had not found the great quantities
of gold. As for the mighty Khan, he was certainly
not in the vicinity of these tropic isles, with their green
paroquets screaming from the waving branches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
palm trees, and their naked savages with soft voices
and hollowed canoes. The majority of the seamen
thought that they had done quite sufficient exploring
and were certainly ready to return to the bullfights
and the crooked streets of old Seville.</p>

<p>“Back to Spain,” they said to Columbus. “Back
to Spain and let other adventurers come here if they
wish. We have found the way for them. Let them
explore and develop this territory.”</p>

<p>Columbus was quite ready to set sail across the Atlantic,
for he had found a new country for the Spanish
Crown, and had added many square miles of territory
to the possessions of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.
It was now the month of January; the skies
were blue and the weather was balmy; so all seemed
propitious for a safe and speedy passage. Leaving
thirty-nine men to garrison a fortress which he ordered
to be constructed, and to search for gold until he could
come back again from Spain, and naming one Rodrigo
de Escovedo as their commander, the Admiral boarded
the <i>Nina</i>, and, after fighting a mimic sham battle with
his men, in order to amuse the Indians, he turned the
prow of the little vessel toward the rising sun. The
<i>Pinta</i>, under the command of Martin Pinzon, had been
cruising to the south for some days; but she now returned,
with the news that, although the natives had
told of a great island to the south where there was much
gold, none existed. The sailors were much distressed
in mind, for they had certainly expected to find a quantity
of gold and treasure in this tropic country.</p>

<p>It was now the seventh day of January and the boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lay to, in order to stop a leak which had sprung in the
hold of the <i>Nina</i>. Columbus profited by the delay and
explored a wide river which flowed from the base of a
high mountain, called Monti Christi by some of the
crew. The Admiral found the banks of this stream
were full of gold-dust&mdash;so much, in fact, that he
named it the Golden River. In spite of this discovery
the Spanish sailors were still anxious to return
and began to murmur against the authority of Columbus.
Thus, on the ninth day of January, the two
caravels set sail, and, steering towards the southeast,
skirted the coast, en route for Spain.</p>

<p>As they swung lazily along, the natives sometimes
followed them in their canoes. One day they began
to shoot at the sailors with their arrows, so that discharge
of musketry had to be resorted to, in order to
drive them away. Two or three of the islanders were
killed in this little affair, and thus, for the first time,
the blood of an Indian flowed beneath the hand of a
European.</p>

<p>Four of the natives were captured and taken on board
so that they might be exhibited in Spain. They went
unwillingly, but, when they endeavored to escape, were
bound to the masts and were forced to join the Spanish
adventurers. So, cruel even in this first expedition to
the new world, just as they were ever afterwards, the
Spanish navigators plowed eastward towards the land
of Ferdinand and Isabella. The passage proved to be
a quick one until the twelfth day of February, when
the vessels encountered a fearful storm lasting three
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The little caravels with their three-cornered sails
were slapped around on the surging billows until all
thought that they were lost, and the sailors swore on
bended knee that they would go and pray in their
shirts, and with naked feet, at the monastery of our
Lady of Loretto, if a Kindly Heaven would only put
an end to this fearful raging of the waters. Columbus
seems to have given up all hope of ever reaching
land, for he wrote out a description of his voyages,
placed it inside a cask, and hurled it into the sea. This
included a request that whoever should find this document
would forward it to the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Luck, however, was with him, and the storm at length
abated to such a degree that the two caravels cast anchor
at the island of St. Mary, one of the Azores. The
crew went ashore, and were immediately thrown into
prison; but, after a period of five days, were allowed
to leave by their Portuguese jailors. Again the two
caravels headed for Spain, but again the winds blew
vigorously, so that the <i>Pinta</i> was driven into the Bay
of Biscay and the <i>Nina</i> had to take refuge at the mouth
of the Tagus, in Portugal.</p>

<p>Here the Portuguese welcomed the Admiral in a
kindly fashion, but he was anxious to return to Spain,
and, as soon as the weather would permit, the <i>Nina</i>
again set sail. Finally, on the fifteenth day of March,
after seven months of navigation, she cast anchor at
the port of Palos, that little harbor from which the man
with a great idea had sailed with a half-hearted and
distrusting crew.</p>

<p>Columbus had guessed correctly. A new land did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
lie far to the westward across the blue Atlantic, and
it was a land where was gold, that which every Spaniard
prized the most. The Genoese mariner had discovered
the islands of San Salvador, Conception, Great
Exuma, Long Island, the Mucaras, Cuba, and San
Domingo.</p>

<p>The first man to give him a welcoming pat on the
back was the good old friar Juan Perez.</p>

<p>“You have done well, my good Columbus,” said he.
“How glad I am that I introduced you to the gracious
Queen Isabella. You have indeed fulfilled the dreams
that you dreamed in the convent of La Rabida.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand and Isabella were then at Barcelona, and,
hearing of the safe return of Columbus, a message was
immediately dispatched to ask him to come at once to
court. The Admiral landed, offered thanks to God for
preserving him in all his trials, and, taking with him
the Indian captives, started on his journey to the residence
of his King. From all parts of the country the
Spanish people ran to look at him as he passed. They
threw their hats in their air, shouting: “Long live
Columbus! Long live the discoverer of new countries!
All honor to the Admiral!” He was preceded by a
troop of cavalry and a band of music when he entered
Barcelona, and flowers were strewn in his pathway.</p>

<p>Ferdinand and Isabella received him with great
pomp at the Deputation. After hearing his story, told
by him with graphic words, all knelt and chanted the Te
Deum. Christopher Columbus was then ennobled by
letters patent, and the King granted him a coat of arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bearing the device: “To Castile and Leon, Columbus
gives a New World.”</p>

<p>The fame of the poor navigator rang throughout all
the then civilized world; the Indians were baptized
in the presence of the whole court; and all tongues gave
praise to this poor and unknown sailor who had dreamed
a dream of conquest which had come true.</p>

<p>Strength of purpose and strength of will had won the
day. Had the Genoese mariner given in to discouragement
when his half-criminal sailors grew mutinous
and wished to return to Spain after they had passed
the Sargossa Sea, to some one else would have belonged
the honor of the discovery of the West Indies. Had
he not used a firm hand in dealing with them, they
would have marooned him on one of the islands which
he discovered and would have left him there to die.
Had he not been sure that he would find what he was
after, Queen Isabella would not have aided him to
glory and renown. Great and valiant Sailor, you
should indeed be remembered with reverence, for you
knew how to triumph over doubt and discouragement
and your faith was sublime! All honor then to Christopher
Columbus!</p>

<p class="p2">The remaining adventures of this gallant soul can
be briefly narrated. Upon a second voyage to the West
Indies he found the men whom he had left behind him
had all been murdered by the Indians. After Columbus
had sailed to Spain the Spaniards had stolen some
of the Indian women and had consequently stirred up
the wrath of the great chief who lived in the interior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the island of Hayti, where they had been instructed to
build a fort and live until the return of their companions.
A row of graves under the swaying palm trees
showed where once had been thirty-nine adventurous
souls from Palos in Spain.</p>

<p>The Spaniards came over in numbers after this expedition,
but, although they founded a city and attempted
to settle in the new world, there were continual dissensions
with the natives; fights; ambuscades; massacres.
The men from Castile were lazy; greedy for gold; cruel
to the natives; and treated them brutally when the
poor Indians could not furnish them with the glittering
metal which they so keenly desired. Then the more
rapacious ones turned on Columbus himself, threw him
in irons on one occasion, and continually derided him
to the King of Spain, who, because the Indies did not
produce the revenues which he had expected them to,
turned coldly upon the mariner from Palos, and rather
took the part of these malcontents against him. Like
all persons who reach a certain pinnacle of greatness,
Columbus could not remain a popular idol, for all
men are human and he had the ambitions of others to
contend with. There were fights with the natives;
fights among the Colonists themselves; fights with the
malaria, the yellow fever, and with other diseases.</p>

<p>Columbus himself fared badly. After the death of
good Queen Isabella, Ferdinand would not aid him in
the least. He had saved no money, after all these
adventures, and, as his life drew to a close, had to live
by borrowing. He did not even own a home in Spain,
and had to reside at Inns and at boarding houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Alone, neglected, miserable, poor, he finally passed to
another and better world, on May the twentieth 1500.
He was seventy years of age.</p>

<p>Buried in the convent of St. Francisco, at Valladolid,
Spain, his body was removed to the monastery of Las
Cuevas at Seville, and, still later, to the cathedral of
San Domingo at Hispaniola. But again it was taken
up, and transported by vessel to Havana, Cuba, that
rich tropic isle which the great navigator himself had
discovered. Here to-day it is lying, and the sad spirit
of this strange man of destiny hovers over the richest
of all the possessions which Spain held in the West
Indies, until wrested from her feeble grasp by the
people of the United States in the year 1898, and magnanimously
presented to the Cuban people themselves,
to govern as they wished.</p>

<p>Could the poor old mariner, as he lay dying at Valladolid,
have but looked forward into the centuries and
seen the New World which he had discovered, he would
have indeed been well satisfied. Had he known that a
great Exposition would have been held to his memory
and fame, and could he have guessed that the children
of the civilized world would ever afterwards be taught
the history of his life, of his perseverance, his courage,
and his faith, he would indeed have been cheered in
those last cheerless and poverty-stricken days.</p>

<p>In the career of this poor Italian dreamer, studying
in every moment of leisure, asking assistance year after
year from crowned heads until he was fifty-six years of
age, in order that he might make his immortal discoveries,
is a lesson to all who feel that their lives have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
not been perhaps worth while as they near middle age.
The lesson is:&mdash;keep on trying to win, and, even
though you may not be appreciated during your lifetime,
history will always give you a proper niche in
the temple of fame. And do not believe that youth is
the only time for adventurous discoveries. Columbus
did not sail upon his epoch-making journey towards the
West until after he had reached his fifty-sixth year.
Middle age and perseverance, then, are good aids to
place one within the halls of the immortals.</p>

<h2 class="p4">AMERIGO VESPUCCI:</h2>

<p class="pch">FLORENTINE NAVIGATOR FROM WHOM<br />
AMERICA HAS DERIVED ITS NAME.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1452-1512)</p>

<p class="drop-cap12">ABOUT the beginning of the thirteenth century a
family called Vespucci established themselves
in the City of Florence, Italy. Anastatio Vespucci
was the head of the family in 1451 and lived in a
stately mansion, now occupied as a hospital for the
poor, near the gate of the city known as Porta del
Prato. He was Secretary of the Senate, and, although
he lived in a palatial dwelling, had little besides the
salary attached to his high office. Upon March the
ninth, 1451, the third son of this official was born, and,
when three days of age, was duly christened Amerigo.
He has since been called Americus.</p>

<p>Almost from his cradle the boy was destined to become
a merchant. Yet he had a good schooling, too,
and was educated at a private institution presided over
by his father’s brother, a monk of the Order of San
Marco, who, before the birth of Americus, had become
famous as a teacher of the noble youths of the city.
Here the boy was taught mathematics, astronomy,
geography, and the classics. He became especially interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in geography and was ambitious to excel as
a geographer.</p>

<p>Amerigo, or Americus, seems to have remained a
student under the direction of his uncle for a number
of years, yet we have no record of when it was that he
followed the wishes of his father and entered upon mercantile
pursuits. At any rate, he never lost his early
interest in geography. In spite of his days in a counting
house, he eagerly studied maps and charts. He
made a collection of them, and, for one map alone, paid
a sum equivalent to five hundred and fifty-five dollars.</p>

<p>Americus had an elder brother, Geralamo, who had
left home to seek his fortune in foreign climes and had
established himself in business in Asia Minor. He became
immensely wealthy, and all went well with him,
until one day, while he was at church, thieves broke
into his house and robbed him of all that he possessed.
This greatly impoverished the family, so that Americus
determined to leave Florence and journey to some other
country where he could retrieve his brother’s losses.
He selected Spain as the scene of his future labors.</p>

<p>Just as Magellan deserted Portugal for Spain, so,
also, Americus felt that here were fame and fortune
awaiting him. Ferdinand and Isabella were then waging
war upon the Moors who held the southern part of
the peninsula, and, as this was regarded as a holy war,
many of the young nobles from surrounding countries
were in Spain fighting for the crown of Castile. The
war created a demand for many articles of commerce,
so Americus went to Spain as the agent for one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Medici, a ruling family in Florence. At the beginning
of the year 1492, when Columbus made his first journey
of exploration to the West Indies, we find the young
Italian associated with one Berardi, who, after the
return of Columbus from his first voyage, was commissioned
to furnish and equip four vessels to be sent
to the New World at different intervals. Vespucci
met Columbus, had lengthy conversations with him regarding
the New World, and, from his letters, we can
see that he had a very clear idea that Cuba was not the
main land, as Columbus supposed it to be, but was an
island.</p>

<p>Berardi died in December, 1495, and the management
of all his affairs devolved upon the shoulders of
Vespucci, who soon wearied of seeking the favors of
fortune and determined to abandon mercantile life for
something, “laudable and stable.” He formed, in
fact, a determination to visit the various parts of the
world, a determination which he soon put into execution.</p>

<p>A navigator, called Ojeda, was about to set sail for
the West Indies with four vessels and we find that
Americus became one of his crew. According to some,
he was to be one of the principal pilots; according to
others he was to be an agent of the King and Queen,
having a voice in the direction of the ships. On May
10th., 1497, the fleet left Cadiz, and, after reaching
the Canary Islands, sailed so rapidly that, at the end
of twenty-seven days, it came in sight of land. This
was the coast of South America.</p>

<p>The Spaniards anchored and attempted to hold some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
intercourse with the natives, but the Indians were very
shy and refused to come out to visit them. So, coasting
along the shore, they came upon a village, which, much
to their surprise, was built after the fashion of the city
of Venice, Italy. The houses were placed upon piers
in the water, and had entrances by means of drawbridges,
so that the inhabitants, by leaving the bridges
down, could traverse the whole town without difficulty.
The explorers therefore called it Venezuela, a name
which has endured to the present day.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, at first, shut themselves up in their
houses and raised the drawbridges, and, as the ships
came nearer, the savages embarked in their canoes and
rowed out to sea. The Spaniards made every mark of
friendship and invited the Indians to come to their
ships, but the brown-skinned natives hastened away,
making signs for the Spaniards to wait where they were,
as they would return. They came back, bringing with
them sixteen young girls, who beckoned to them and
made signals of peace. The Castilians were much impressed
by this; so much so, in fact, that their suspicions
were not aroused by the sight of numerous
natives who came swimming towards the ships. Suddenly
they noticed that some of the women at the
doors of the huts were wailing and tearing their hair,
as if in great distress.</p>

<p>While wondering what this meant, suddenly all the
girls sprang from their canoes, and the Spaniards saw
that many men&mdash;who had been heretofore hidden by
them&mdash;were armed with a bow and arrows. Each
native in the water had a lance in his or her hand.
Hardly had the white men perceived this before they
were furiously attacked.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards vigorously defended themselves with
their muskets and then made a dash for the canoes in
their long boats. They overturned several, killed
about twenty of the South Americans, and took two of
the girls and three men prisoners. Many of the natives
were wounded. The Spaniards did not burn the
town, but returned to their ships, where they placed
the three men, whom they had captured, in irons.
Then they sailed southward, but, when morning
dawned, discovered that the natives had managed to
wiggle out of their irons and had jumped overboard.</p>

<p>Keeping their course continually along the coast, the
explorers came to anchor about eighty miles from this
new-world Venice, where they saw about four thousand
persons gathered upon the shore. These set up a wild
yelping, when the Spaniards let down their boats, and
fled into the forest. The white men followed and
found a camp where two natives were engaged in cooking
iguanas, an animal which the early discoverers
describe as a serpent. The two cooks fled, of course,
but the whites disturbed nothing in the camp, in order
to reassure the natives, and then leisurely returned to
their boats.</p>

<p>Upon the following day these Indians paddled to the
ships, and when they saw the two girl prisoners whom
the Spaniards had taken, they became suddenly very
friendly, for these girls belonged to a tribe with which
they were then at war.</p>

<p>“We have only come here for the fishing,” said one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of them, a chief. “We live far back in the country
and wish you to journey to see us as our friends.”</p>

<p>The invitation was received with great satisfaction
by the whites.</p>

<p>“They importuned us so much,” says Vespucci in
his narrative of these events, published some years
afterwards, “that, having taken counsel, twenty-three
of us Christians concluded to go with them, well prepared,
and with firm resolution to die manfully, if such
was to be our fate.”</p>

<p>So, the Spaniards journeyed inland, remained three
days at the fishing camp, and then set out for the interior,
where they visited so many villages that they
were nine days on the journey, and their comrades on
board the vessels grew very uneasy about them. The
Indians, in fact, showed them great attention, and
when they were about to return to the ships, insisted
upon carrying them along in hammocks, slung upon the
shoulders of strong and willing porters. When the
explorers arrived at the shore, their boats were almost
swamped by the numbers of savages who wished to
accompany them, while swarms of natives who could
not get into the boats, swam alongside to the ships. So
many came aboard, that the mariners were quite
troubled, fearing that they might make a sudden and
unexpected attack. A cannon was fired off to impress
the natives with the power of the explorers. At the
explosion of the piece, many leaped into the sea, like
frogs plunging into a marsh. Those who remained
seemed to be unafraid and took leave of the mariners
with many demonstrations of affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards had now been thirteen months at sea,
so their thoughts turned towards home. It was therefore
decided to careen their vessels on the beach, in
order to calk and pitch them anew, as they leaked
badly, and then they would return to Spain. The
Castilians made a breastwork of their boats and their
casks, and placed their artillery so that it would play
upon any enemies who might advance; then, having
unloaded and lightened their ships, they hauled them
on land to make much needed repairs.</p>

<p>No attack was made by the natives. Instead of this
the South Americans brought them food, begging them
to assist them in punishing a very cruel tribe of people
who came to their country, every year, from the sea,
and killed many of their warriors. They afterwards
would eat them. Against these enemies they said
that they were unable to defend themselves. When the
Spaniards promised to march against the cannibals, no
words could express their gratitude. Many wished to
go with them, but the whites wisely rejected such offers,
permitting only seven to accompany them.</p>

<p>The Spaniards sailed in a northeasterly direction for
seven days, and then came upon some islands, many of
which were peopled. They cast anchor before one of
them and lowered the boats; but, as they did so, they
saw about four hundred men and women gather on the
beach; the men armed with bows, arrows, and lances,
their naked bodies painted with various colors. As
the Castilians approached to within bowshot of the
shore, the savages sent a flight of arrows at them in an
effort to prevent them from landing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The cannon were therefore loaded and fired. As
some of the Indians fell dead, the rest retreated. The
Castilians, with a cheer, hastily landed and fell upon
the savages, who put up a stiff fight. The battle raged
for about two hours without a decisive victory upon
either side; some of the Indians were killed and some
of the whites were injured. At last, tired out, the explorers
were glad enough to return to their vessels.</p>

<p>Next day the Spaniards landed again, and, under the
leadership of Vespucci, had a bloody battle with the
cannibals. The natives were at length badly worsted,
were driven to their village, and this was burned to the
ground. Only one of the explorers was killed, while
twenty-two were wounded. Many of the Indians were
burned in the ruins of their thatched huts.</p>

<p>Well satisfied with the outcome of this affair, the
mariners now set sail for Spain, with the plaudits of
the savages, whom they had assisted, ringing in their
ears. They arrived in October, 1498, after an absence
of about nineteen months, and were well received by
the King and Queen, for they brought considerable
gold, jewels, and skins of strange beasts and birds.
Vespucci was highly pleased; he had been the first to
visit the shore of South America and had really done
something great in exploration,&mdash;his dream for many
years.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return, a second expedition was
prepared for a journey to this new-found country,
headed by one Ojeda, a Spaniard of some wealth and
influence. A fleet of four vessels was equipped, and
the latter part of the Spring of 1499 saw them ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
for sea. The reputation of Vespucci as a geographer
was such as to make him the very man needed for this
particular voyage, and, although at first disinclined to
leave home at so early a date, he finally yielded to the
entreaties of Ojeda, and joined the party.</p>

<p>They set sail from Cadiz in May, 1499, and twenty-four
days later saw land. The shore was low and so
densely covered with small aromatic trees that the explorers
concluded to return to their ships and try some
other spot. After coasting along in a southerly direction
they came to the mouth of a great river, and,
having manned their boats with twenty well-armed
adventurers, entered the stream and ascended it for
more than fifty miles. But the land was as low, up-stream,
as it was at the mouth, so the reconnoitering
party floated down-stream to the fleet again. Anchors
were raised, the ships stood out to sea, and, sailing in a
southerly direction, encountered the great equatorial
current which sweeps along the coast of Brazil.</p>

<p>“We could scarcely make any headway against it,”
says Amerigo, in his description of this journey published
some years later. “Seeing that we made no
progress, or but very little, and also seeing the danger
to which we were exposed, we determined to turn our
prows to the northwest.”</p>

<p>Ten degrees north of the equator, the explorers again
saw land, and, drawing nearer, found that this was an
island. Many of the inhabitants were gathered upon
the shore; but, when the pale-faced strangers landed,
they took fright and ran into the woods. Fortunately
two were captured and acted as envoys, so, after a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the rest allowed the Spaniards to approach and speak
with them. They were cannibals, eating the bodies of
all those whom they killed or captured in war, and had
the heads and bones of those who had been eaten piled
up in a big heap. Much disgusted at what they had
seen, the Spaniards sailed away.</p>

<p>Drowsing along the coast of this island they came to
another village of the same tribe, where they were hospitably
received and were fed by the brown-skinned inhabitants.
But they moved onward, sailed westward,
and soon anchored near one of the mouths of the Orinoco
River, where was a large village close to the sea,
the inhabitants of which regaled the mariners with
three different kinds of wine, and presented them with
eleven large pearls, more than a hundred smaller ones,
and a small quantity of gold. Here the navigators
remained seventeen days, feasting upon fruits and the
savory acorns with which the place abounded. Then
they continued along the coast, stopping occasionally
to hold intercourse with the natives.</p>

<p>These, for the most part, were unfriendly, and the
Spaniards had many a battle with the South Americans.</p>

<p>Vespucci says: “Many times not more than sixteen
of us fought with two thousand of them, and, in
the end defeated them, killing many and robbing their
houses. We were obliged to fight with a great many
people, but we always had the victory.”</p>

<p>Thus they progressed upon their way, fighting, trading,
exploring, until their stock of provisions became so
nearly exhausted that it was impossible for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
proceed further. Their ships, too, were sea-worn and
leaky, so that the pumps could scarcely keep them free
from water.</p>

<p>Other Spanish adventurers had founded a city called
Hispaniola, not long before this, situated upon the eastern
coast of Panama. The Ojeda expedition was now
about three hundred and sixty miles from the point, but
it was decided to sail thither in order to repair the
ships and secure food, such as Europeans were accustomed
to. After a voyage of several weeks, the Spanish
caravels anchored in the harbor of the city founded
by their countrymen, where they remained for two
months.</p>

<p>Refreshed by their stay at Hispaniola, the Spaniards
now cruised for some time among the numberless small
islands north of Hayti, but the provisions which they
had secured soon began to give out; they were reduced
to six ounces of bread and three small measures of
water a day for each man; and the ships began to leak
again, in spite of all the caulking which had been done
at Hispaniola. The leaders of the expedition, therefore,
decided to capture some slaves for the purpose of
selling to wealthy grandees in Spain, and to return
home.</p>

<p>This harsh resolution was well carried out. Two
hundred and thirty-two unfortunate natives were torn
from their island home and their pleasant, indolent life,
and were taken on board the ships. It was a dastardly
thing to do, but men in these times were like the German
invaders of Belgium in ours,&mdash;they were brutes.
The prows of the four caravels were now turned towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Spain, and, after an uneventful voyage, they arrived
at their place of departure, June 8th., 1500, after an
absence of about thirteen months. Of the fifty-seven
men who had set out upon the expedition, two had been
killed by the Indians, the rest returned home. Thirty-two
of the slaves died upon the journey across the
Atlantic, the rest were sold to the Spanish grandees.</p>

<p>Amerigo wrote freely of the journey to South
America and his letters had a wide circulation, for he
was the first newspaper correspondent: the forerunner
of the modern Richard Harding Davis-es and Frank G.
Carpenters. By means of these epistles he gained a
wide celebrity and his name became more closely connected
with the New World than that of Columbus.
Such being the case, it is no wonder that people began
to call these new possessions after the man who wrote
so graphically of what he had seen there. Amerigo
Vespucci told of a land which came to be known as
the land of Americus, or America. It should really
have been called Columbia, after Christopher Columbus,
but Columbus did not happen to have the facility
for writing interesting letters.</p>

<p>Amerigo, greatly pleased with what he had accomplished,
was resting quietly at Seville, when an invitation
came from the King of Portugal to have him
visit him, and, when he arrived at Lisbon, the King
had much to say to him.</p>

<p>“Would he undertake another expedition to the new
world under the Portuguese banner?” Yes, he would.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. On May 13th, 1501, Vespucci
left on another journey with three armed caravels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
They ran south, touched at the Canary Islands,
and then, through fierce and violent tempests, plowed
towards the coast of South America. This they
reached at length, and, coasting southward, frequently
landed on the shore, where they had intercourse with
the natives, most of whom were cannibals.</p>

<p>Here the Spaniards remained for several months,
then, having found no minerals of value in the country,
although there was a great abundance of valuable woods
of every kind, they decided to return to Portugal. All
the vessels were stocked with food and with water for
six months, their prows were turned eastward, and,
bidding the cannibals of South America a fond adieu,
the explorers headed for home. After a stormy passage,
and, after a voyage of fifteen months, the adventurous
navigators again sailed into the harbor of Lisbon,
where they were received with much joy. Florence
received the accounts of the discoveries of her illustrious
son with much pride, and honors were bestowed
upon those members of his family who lived in
the city of the Arno.</p>

<p>Amerigo Vespucci was now a popular idol. He had
been the discoverer of the method of obtaining longitude
at sea, by observing the conjunction of the moon with
one of the planets, and his observations and enumeration
of the stars in the southern heavens were of great
value to mariners who came after him. He was far in
advance of most other learned men of the age in his
knowledge of the sciences of astronomy and geometry.</p>

<p>Believing that Amerigo would have reached India by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
way of the southwest, had not his last voyage been interrupted
by the severe storm which he had encountered,
the King of Portugal lost no time in fitting out another
expedition. Six vessels were therefore prepared,
Amerigo being placed in command of one of them, and
recognized as the scientific authority of the squadron.
The fleet set sail again for that country of which all
Europe was talking and speculating.</p>

<p>This expedition was similar to those which preceded
it. The vessels met with severe storms; saw cannibals,
brightly plumaged birds, and islands of palm groves
and chattering parrots. The Spaniards built a fortress
upon one of the many harbors which they entered;
then, as all but one ship had been lost by shipwreck,
the vessel which Vespucci commanded sailed back to
Lisbon, arriving on June 18th., 1504. He was received
as one risen from the dead, for the whole city
had given him up for lost.</p>

<p>Thus ended the last voyage of the famous Florentine.
Perhaps disheartened by the unfortunate result
of his cruise, he abandoned the idea of again going to
sea, and devoted himself to writing an account of
what he had already accomplished. Although younger
by four years than Columbus, when the great Admiral
had set sail upon his first voyage to the unknown West,
Amerigo decided to rest upon laurels already won, and
to never again tempt fame and fortune in an expedition
to the shores of South America. He spent his
declining years in writing a full and graphic account
of his many expeditions to the New World, and, on
February the twenty-second, 1512, the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
astronomer and geographer passed to a better sphere.</p>

<p>For many years after its discovery there seems to
have been no effort to give a name to the New World;
indeed, it was so long supposed to be a part of Asia that
this was thought to be unnecessary. In a Latin book,
printed at Strassburg, Germany, in 1509&mdash;the work
of an Italian called Ilacomilo&mdash;it was suggested that
the country be called America, as it was discovered by
Amerigo (Americus).</p>

<p>Not in the lifetime of the great Vespucci was this
name so used. As late as the year 1550, North
America was called Terra Florida on the Spanish maps,
while Brazil was the name given to the coast of South
America, where much dye-wood was obtained; the
title coming from the Portuguese word <i>braza</i>, meaning
live coal, or glowing fire. Both the names of
America and Brazil were applied to the shore of South
America, until, after a while, the second of these names
was confined to that part of the coast where the valuable
dye-wood was obtained, while the other name was
attached to the part north and south of it. From this
it was but a short step to speaking of all of the great
southern peninsula as America, and gradually this
name was given to the entire western continent.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Spain or Italy, Amerigo Vespucci
sleeps in an unknown grave, but his epitaph is the
name of a double continent: rich, populous, teeming
with all things valuable.</p>

<p>Of noble thought, splendid mind, and facile pen, the
memory of the great Florentine geographer should be
revered and respected for all time.</p>

<h2 class="p4">JUAN PONCE DE LEON:</h2>

<p class="pch">DREAMER AND SEARCHER FOR THE<br />FOUNTAIN OF PERPETUAL<br />YOUTH.</p>

<p class="pch">(1460-1521)</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">ONCE there lived in the island of Porto Rico,
which became the property of the United
States in 1898, a Spanish Knight who had
fought against the Moors in Spain and who had helped
to drive them from his native country. His name was
Juan Ponce de Leon, and he was rich in slaves, in plantations,
and in money.</p>

<p>The good knight was growing old. As he gazed in
his mirror he saw that his once coal-black beard was
now silvered with gray, that his head was not only
bald, but also grizzled, and, as for his joints, well, he
had strange rheumatic pains when he bent over, and he
did not leap out of bed in the morning with the same
spirit of enthusiasm that he had had twenty years
before.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that this wrinkled soldier gave eager
ear to the remarks of a native chieftain, Atamara, who
one day said to the gray-haired veteran:</p>

<p>“I see, good sir, that you are nearing a time when
you will have to bid farewell to all your earthly possessions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which will, I know, be far from pleasing to you.
If you sail to the westward, you will find a fountain
whose waters will restore the full vigor of youth. No
matter how old you may be, should you but drink of
this marvelous spring, you will be again twenty years
of age. Your aches and pains will disappear, and you
will enjoy life even as you did when a stripling.”</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon pricked up his ears at this, and
eagerly questioned the chief concerning the direction
which the fountain lay from the Isle of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>“It lies towards the northwest,” said the Indian.
“Here a man and a woman, called Idona and Nomi,
who had grown old together, came down to drink. Filling
a pearly shell which lay near the water, first Nomi
handed it to Idona, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Drink, my love, that I may know thou wilt not
part from me forever, for I have heard from the wind
that this is a magic fountain where the water has the
power of returning one’s youth.’</p>

<p>“Idona drank, then turned and filled the cup for his
mate. A marvel now came to pass. There stood
Nomi, beautiful as in her youth; garlanded, too, with
flowers as when Idona had first seen her, and facing her
was her lover in all the glory of his young manhood.</p>

<p>“And, because these two had been so faithful to
their pledges and had borne the pains of life so bravely
together, the Spirit of the Earth led them to her own
home, where they dwelt happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p>“But once in twelve moons they come to the fountain
to drink together of its waters.</p>

<p>“This is the legend of the water,” concluded Atamara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
“as it has been known amongst us from a time so
far away that our wise men cannot measure it.”</p>

<p>Nowadays no one would give credence to such a
legend, but those days were different from the present.
For had not hundreds of Spaniards believed in the El
Dorado, or gilded man, and had not they followed De
Soto in order to view him? So the Knight of Spain
asked many questions of Atamara concerning his knowledge
of the land where was the Fountain of Youth, and
he learned enough to satisfy himself that many unexplored
islands and seas lay to the northward, which
were only waiting for the eyes of some venturesome
Castilian. He still had an iron constitution, built up
by sound habits, military training, and temperate living;
and he felt that he was not yet too old to use his
good sword to carve out a greater dominion in new
territories. On the other hand, he had reached the
downward turn of life so that this tale of the Fountain
of Youth appealed to him the more he pondered upon
it; and he determined to go and seek for this mysterious
water, even as De Soto had sought for the Gilded Man.</p>

<p>The King of Spain was quite ready to grant this
knight permission to discover, explore, and colonize the
fabled land of which De Leon now wrote him, and sent
him a letter which ran as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">“To the Knight Don Juan Ponce de Leon. Inasmuch
as you, Juan Ponce de Leon, have sent and asked
permission to go and discover the Island of Biminin, in
accordance with certain conditions herein stated, and
in order to confer on you this favor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“We grant you that you may discover, explore, and
colonize the said island, provided that it be not heretofore
discovered and under the conditions herein stated,
to wit:</p>

<p>“First, that you, Juan Ponce de Leon, take with
you such ships as you require for the discovery of the
said island, and for the carrying out of such projects.
We grant you a period of three years, dating from the
day which you receive this document, with the understanding
that you are to set out on this voyage of discovery
the first year, also during your outward course
you are privileged to touch at such islands, or mainlands
in the ocean, as yet undiscovered, provided they
do not belong to the King of Portugal, our much beloved
son. Nor can you take anything whatever save such
articles as are required for your sustenance, and the
equipment of your ships, paying for them according to
value received.</p>

<p>“Moreover, to you, Ponce de Leon, in finding and
discovering said island, we accord the Governorship,
also the administration of justice, during your lifetime,
and, to insure the privilege, we will make your
authority extend to the civil and criminal jurisdiction,
including every and all issues, and rights annexed.</p>

<p>“I order that the Indians be distributed among the
people who make the first discoveries, as they should
receive the most advantages.</p>

<p>“Dated at Burgos, January 22nd., 1512.</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">I, the King Fernando.</span></p>

<p>“Signed by the Bishop of Valencia.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">De Leon overhauled his caravels, accumulated stores
of arms, provisions, gifts, and trinkets of various kinds
that would be suited to the tastes of the Indians whom
he should find in these lands which he might discover,
and arranged his home affairs. He had three caravels
in all, and three hundred sailors and soldiers. Besides
these, were several priests, for whose accommodation
a chapel was built upon the after deck of the
<i>Dolores</i>, the largest vessel. All things were now ready,
and, bidding his good wife, the Dona Dolores, farewell,
the Spanish adventurer turned the prow of his
flagship towards the west, and sailed through azure
seas, whose very fish were rainbow tinted, in quest of
the Fountain of Youth.</p>

<p>The air was balmy, scented with the sweet odors of
fruits and flowers, and fragrant with the spices of
mango trees. The vessels drifted onward from one
fairy-like islet to another, at all of which they made a
brief stay, searching for that marvelous fountain of
which the Indian had spoken.</p>

<p>Brown-skinned natives came from the forests, bearing
gifts of precious stones, of fruit, and of beauteous
flowers, for which they refused any recompense.
White beaches glistened in the tropic sunlight as if
their sands were polished grains of silver, and, as the
caravels luffed under the lee of some of these palm-studded
isles, the sailors saw quiet coves, shining like
polished mirrors, into which crystal streams gurgled
with murmurs almost human.</p>

<p>The Castilians were charmed with the beautiful
scenery, and many said: “Surely in this land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
peace and beauty there must be a Fountain of perpetual
Youth.”</p>

<p>So they kept onward towards the north, ever looking
for the marvellous water which was to turn their grizzled
leader into a youth again.</p>

<p>The sailors gazed at the many birds which fluttered
in the palms and sometimes hovered near their
ships. There were white egrets, or herons, parroquets
with green and yellow plumage, pink curlews, and
flamingos with scarlet feathers and long curved bills.
There were great sea turtles splashing in the shallows
with huge, flabby feet, and gray sharks which
whirled about amidst the foam in eager search for their
prey.</p>

<p>Everywhere the natives were friendly, and, when
asked if they knew aught of the Fountain of Youth,
would shake their heads. Vainly the Spaniards drank
of all the springs and the rivulets in these tropic isles,
for none seemed to possess the wonderful healing properties
for which they longed. The brown-skinned islanders
knew little of Atamara’s legend of the fountain,
but they spoke of a great land lying far beyond, where
perhaps the wondrous water might be spouting. It
was a fine country, said they, called by the musical
name of Florida.</p>

<p>One moonlight evening, as De Leon sat upon the high
deck of his caravel, when his vessels threaded a channel
between two shadowy islands upon the port and the
starboard, suddenly, far, far in front of him he beheld
a brownish gray strip of country. It was an hour when
revery would take the form of dreams, and, fearing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the vision of coast and headland, gulf, bays, palm trees
and ports-of-refuge might be some delusive vision of
the brain, he turned to his companion, Perez de Esequera,
saying:</p>

<p>“Is it true that I view the shadowy sea-coast of some
undiscovered land? I see great bays, indentations, and
projections. I believe, good Perez, that we are nearing
a shore from which many Spains, nay, all of Europe
might be carved and scarcely missed. Pray that the
saints shall guide us to the land of Bimini and to that
wondrous fountain of perpetual youth!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, good Knight,” replied his companion. “I,
also, see this vision. It may be a mirage, but I feel
that soon we shall find this country of which the
natives tell. Let us be optimistic!”</p>

<p>Next day the vessels were headed towards the north,
and, with a stiff breeze filling the bellying canvas, made
progress onward. During the night, the sailors of De
Leon’s caravel heard the distant booming of breakers,
and awakened their leader. The good knight called to
his sailing-master to make soundings, which showed that
they were in shallow water. So the anchors were let
go, the sails were furled, and the vessels lay waiting for
the coming of the day.</p>

<p>Dawn reddened in the east, and, far to the north and
south of the anchorage, stretched a multitude of sand
dunes. The surging billows of the Atlantic threw
white wisps of spray upon a long yellowish beach, beyond
which was a background of dark green forests.
From the masthead a sailor called out that he saw a
winding river, coursing through grassy marshes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
grew broad and green-gray as it reached the ocean. It
was Palm Sunday, March the 27th., 1512, so the Castilians
sang the Te Deum and, with ringing cheers,
gave voice to their pleasure in finding the fabled land
of Florida.</p>

<p>When the vessels neared the beach, next day, the
adventurers saw that there was little here but a succession
of sand hills. So the Spaniards coasted along by
the booming surf and at length reached a sheltered bay
which they called the Bay of the Holy Cross. Many
native canoes were seen disappearing into narrow
creeks among the marshes, so it was apparent that the
Indians had no desire to become acquainted with these
strange mariners in the queer-shaped caravels. The
ships anchored and that night De Leon called his captains
and lieutenants on board his flag ship for counsel.
It was decided that on the morning a landing
should be made, in force, and that formal possession
should be taken of this soil in the name of King Ferdinand
of Spain.</p>

<p>The next morning was the second of April, a time
when the foliage of Florida is at its best. As day
crept on, boats were lowered along the sloping sides of
the little caravels, which rapidly filled with armored
men upon whose greaves and breastplates the sunlight
flashed and gleamed with silvery reflections in the
green-black water. Waving plumes and crimson scarfs
tossed in the morning breeze, while high above all
gleamed the golden cross borne by the Chaplain, good
Father Antonio. The commander had decreed that all
should appear in the best of armor and equipment so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that the honor due the King of Spain by his followers
should be ample and sufficient.</p>

<p>The tide being full, the boats landed high up on the
shore, Ponce De Leon leading the way, and being the
first to step upon the soil which would thenceforth be
his by decree of his Sovereign. Halting, the cavalier
waited for Father Antonio with his cross, before which,
on bended knee, he gave thanks to God for his great
mercy in bringing him safely to this goodly land.</p>

<p>Now all disembarked, and, while trumpets sounded
and drums beat, formed a procession headed by the
priests, the cross, and Ponce de Leon with his banner.
Marching to the roll of drum and the blare of bugle, the
cavalcade went some distance up the beach to a spot
where the priests had erected the chapel altar, decorated
with sacred emblems and votive offerings. This was
in the square of an Indian village. The golden cross
was placed in a position facing the morning sun and
the soldiers knelt in a semi-circle around it, as service
was held to commemorate this auspicious event.</p>

<p>Save for the deep booming of the sea, and the song
of a mocking bird, there was silence. The Indians
peered at the strange sight from behind trees and
bushes in the neighboring forest, and, perceiving that
the fair-skinned strangers were engaged in some ceremony
or proceedings, they looked upon the crouching
Spaniards with expressions of awe.</p>

<p>The mass was soon ended, and Ponce de Leon took
formal possession of the country in the name of his
sovereign, proclaiming himself, by virtue of the royal
authority, Adelantodo of the Land of Florida. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a fanfare of trumpets rent the air, mingled with the
cheers of the soldiers.</p>

<p>A small stone pillar was now set up, which had been
brought from Porto Rico for that purpose, and upon
which was carved a cross, the royal arms, and an inscription
reciting the discovery of Florida and its possession
by the Crown of Spain.</p>

<p>Although De Leon felt that he was really the first
Spaniard to find this country, such was really not the
case, for the outline of the peninsula is plainly drawn in
an old map published in the year 1502. To this discovery
little attention seems to have been paid at the
time, for it was a period when explorers were most
anxious to find gold and pearls and there was nothing
to fix particular attention to this new coast. Thus
Ponce de Leon’s vaunted first vision was really a rediscovery
of what an earlier and equally valiant Castilian
had seen.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, who had landed, it seems, not far
from the site of St. Augustine, found, when they attempted
to search for the Fountain of Perpetual
Youth, that the natives did not have quite as good an
opinion of their mission as they could wish.</p>

<p>After they had sailed from the Bay of the Holy
Cross the wise men of the Indian village concluded
that the stone pillar represented something inimical
to their own rights of possession, so they had it taken
to the deepest part of the bay and there thrown overboard.
Previous to this they had vigorously protested
against the invasion of their peaceful country. Yet no
blows had been struck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The caravels headed down the coast with fair wind
behind them and, not far from the southern point of the
island, which formed the seaward barrier of the Bay of
the Holy Cross, they saw a curious spot upon the surface
of the sea where the water boiled like a caldron, or
as if some mighty fountain flowed upward from a hole
in the bed of the ocean. This is a natural well in the
Atlantic, quite similar to those on land, and can still be
seen by sailors off the Florida coast. There were great
schools of fish nearby, and many were captured in nets
as the vessels drifted slowly upon their course.</p>

<p>The voyagers coasted along the low-lying shore, admiring
the view, and finally saw a canoe approaching
in which was a handsome youth, the messenger from a
native chieftain Sannatowah. He bore a missive to
the effect that, if the strangers came in peace, he was
ready to meet them in the same spirit, also; but if they
came not with such intent, it would be best for them to
remain on board their floating houses, for there were
as many warriors in the land as there were palm trees
in the forests.</p>

<p>“How shall it be known whether we come in peace
or in war?” asked Ponce de Leon.</p>

<p>“By this,” answered the herald, touching the bow
which was slung over his shoulder, “if it be war.
Or this,” laying his hand upon a green branch thrust
in his girdle, “if it be peace. There are eagle eyes
watching on yonder shore, and, whichever I hold up,
the message goes straight to Sannatowah!”</p>

<p>“And if I let you make no sign nor go back, what
then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“War!” was the answer.</p>

<p>A smile came to the serious countenance of the
Spanish seeker for the Fountain of Youth as he
said:</p>

<p>“I pray thee, then, young sea eagle, go to the prow of
my ship and hold up the green bough of peace. I
pledge you my sacred word that there shall be peace
between thy people and mine as long as it is in my
power to have it so. Tell me if there be any answer
from the shore and if all is well. Tarry with us, so as
to be our herald to your cacique.”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, the youthful Indian went forward,
and, standing upon the bowsprit, waved his
green branch first towards the south, next to the north,
and then towards the sky. This over, he came back to
the after deck, saying:</p>

<p>“All is well. Sannatowah and his people will greet
you as friends and as guests.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards soon went ashore, greeted the Indian
chieftain, and were told by him that, two days’ easy
journey to the westward, lay several great springs and
a mighty river, the beginning and end of which was
unknown to him. One of these springs, said he, was
in the territory of a tribe with which they were now
at war; but, when he was a youth, there had been peace,
and he had often visited it. This spring was deemed
to be sacred. It was a great fountain which welled up
from the depths of the earth and was apparently bottomless.
Its waters were as clear as azure, so that one
could see far into the pearly depths.</p>

<p>“I drank not of it,” he continued, “for the wise men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the tribe said that it was forbidden by the Great
Spirit, except to one of the tribe in whose land it was.
The fountain is in the country of Tegesta.”</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon tarried quietly in the bay for several
days; but finally landed his men, in order to travel to
the place where lay this wondrous fountain. He had
ten horses on the caravels and one mule. These were
lowered overboard and swam ashore, which occasioned
much surprise and astonishment among the natives,
who viewed these strange animals with both fear and
distrust.</p>

<p>When Father Antonio’s long-eared mule climbed
from the ocean and struck the solid earth with his
hoofs (the first of his kind to come to Florida) and then
opened his mouth for one long, piercing bray, all the
natives took to the woods in impulsive flight. It was
some time before they dared to return.</p>

<p>Sannatowah was eager to befriend De Leon, and sent
him guides to pilot him to the place where lay the great
river and the crystal spring; and, although usually
averse to such labor, a number of redskins went along
as porters, agreeing of their own free will to go at least
as far as their own boundaries. Everything was soon
ready, the trumpets blared out their clarion notes of
warning, and the march began.</p>

<p>Through forests of great oaks, magnolias and palm
trees which hung with streamers of long, gray moss
and matted vines, the Spaniards wended their way,
startling many a shy deer from the leafy coverts
and once or twice a great brown bear, which lumbered
away, snorting with fear. Mocking birds trilled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
them from leafy branches, and squirrels chattered and
scolded from fallen tree trunks.</p>

<p>Carrying his helmet at his saddle-bow, so that he
might feel the refreshing breeze, De Leon rode at the
head of the little column of horse and foot until they
came to a place in the forest where a great tree lay
prostrate over the trail.</p>

<p>“This,” said the native guides, “is the border of our
lands. Beyond is Tegesta. We can go no farther,
for, while the flower of peace<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> blooms, there is a truce
between ourselves and those who live beyond.”</p>

<p>So the Spaniards made camp, but next morning they
pressed onward into the wilderness, and, passing
around a great cypress swamp, suddenly came upon an
Indian village named Colooza, near a large lake. They
were met with a shower of arrows, but, clapping spurs
to their horses, soon drove the redskins behind a rude
stockade which surrounded their thatched huts.</p>

<p>De Leon flung himself from his horse, and, regardless
of the arrows which were singing around him and
were glancing from his steel breastplate, he led a
charge upon the gate, with a wild cry of “St. Iago and
at them!” With his battle-ax he swept an entrance
to the palisade, and then, dashing in, followed by his
men, the village was soon cleared of all but five of the
native Floridians. These, apparently awed by the
invulnerability of their opponents, gave in and surrendered.
They were compelled to go along with the
Spaniards as guides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through a country of well-tilled fields and
gardens, where were picturesque clusters of native
houses, the discoverers came to the waters of a great
lake which was so wide that the woods were scarcely distinguishable
upon the opposite shore. This was Lake
Munroe, a broad expanse of the St. Johns River, which
enters it at one end and flows from it at the other. De
Leon here halted, sending the captured natives onward
to find the chief of this country, telling them to assure
him that the white men were peacefully inclined and
were in search of the fabled and mystical Fountain of
Perpetual Youth, which they had heard was in the territory
over which he held dominion.</p>

<p>At nightfall, one of these native runners appeared at
the camp, bearing the reply of the great chief Olatheta,
which was that he was delighted to learn that the
strangers did not wish to war with him and requested
that their leader should meet him at the council house
upon the following day.</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon was overjoyed. Now he was nearing
his goal, for he believed that the Fountain of Perpetual
Youth lay only a few leagues before him.
Eagerly he awaited the morrow, and, at the time set for
the advance, heralds came from Olatheta to conduct the
Spaniards to their chieftain.</p>

<p>The Castilians soon came upon a great collection of
dwellings, many of which were quite large, and before
the largest of all was the chieftain with his principal
men. As they entered the town, the signal was given
for the trumpeters to blow and the drums to beat. This
caused great fear among the natives so that many ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
away; but, seeing that there were no signs of hostility
on the part of the strangers, they resumed their wonted
attitude of stoical reserve.</p>

<p>“Pray, why have you come to this country?”
asked Olatheta. “Are you peaceful, or are you warlike?”</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon bowed.</p>

<p>“I am the servant of a Great King beyond the
water,” said he, “and he has given me the Governorship
of these islands. So I have brought with me a
holy man to teach you the true religion, and, as I have
heard that you have here the Fountain of Perpetual
Youth, I would like to visit it and to drink of its wonderous
waters.”</p>

<p>Olatheta smiled, as he answered:</p>

<p>“There is a great fountain near at hand, which we
all reverence and hold sacred. Yet, because my people
have transgressed the proper laws of our tribe, the
Great Spirit has taken much of its virtue from it. If,
however, you wish to visit it, I will willingly accompany
you. This holy man of yours may induce the
great God to restore its power, which will be such a
great blessing to my people that they will all rejoice at
your coming, instead of being angry with you, as many
are now, because of your attack upon Colooza.”</p>

<p>“Let us journey to this spring immediately,” said
De Leon with enthusiasm. “Good chieftain, lead
on!”</p>

<p>Olatheta arose, and, beckoning to the Spaniards to
attend him, walked rapidly away. The Castilians followed,
surrounded by a vast multitude of natives, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
crowded around them in wonder and curiosity. As
they wound through the thickets, Father Antonio’s
mule startled every one with a series of the most ear-piercing
brays, which caused an instant panic among
the Indians, coupled with loud laugher from the soldiers.</p>

<p>“By the Saint of San Sebastian,” cried a Sergeant,
called Bartola, “were that mule mine and were this
indeed the fountain whereof we are in search, I should
see to it that he drank not a drop of its waters.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked a smiling comrade.</p>

<p>“Why? A pretty question truly. Because there
would be no place for any sound on earth, if the waters
would have such virtue to increase vigor as they are
said to have. All would have to fly before the thunderous
braying of yonder ass.”</p>

<p>The cavalcade passed onward, and, nearing a grove
of stately trees, the eager Spaniards saw a fountain such
as they had never seen before in any other land. There
was a brim as round as a huge cup, and inside were
waters as clear as crystal, which boiled up from depths
lost in inky shadows, and ran over the edge into a little
water course, which gushed and bubbled towards the
lake.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the eager De Leon. “It must indeed
be the Fountain of Youth! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurrah!”</p>

<p>The day was a beautiful one. Bright birds darted
from the waving branches, the sun shone brilliantly
upon the armor of the Spanish adventurers, as, with the
horsemen in advance, clad with plumed helmets, silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shields, upon which were emblazoned red lions, and
with sword and battle-axe clanking against their armored
legs, the Spaniards neared the gushing waters
of the fountain.</p>

<p>In front of all was the good Father Antonio, who,
holding with one hand the bridle-rein of his dun-brown
mule, raised the other in blessing. The Indians
crowded around him, awed by the sonorous Latin, and,
as he finished his benediction, Olatheta stepped forward
and filled an earthen cup, which he had brought, with
water dipped from the fountain. Turning about he
handed it to Ponce de Leon.</p>

<p>Smiling, and with a trembling hand, the good knight
raised the cup to his lips. The cool liquid gurgled
down his bronzed and weather-beaten throat. Yet&mdash;oh!
sad and distressing to relate! No part of his grizzled
exterior changed to the freshness of youth.</p>

<p>As he was raising this goblet to his lips, his companions
rushed tumultuously to the fountain and buried
their heated faces in the clear and sparkling water.
They drank deeply, and in silence awaited the beginning
of miracles, each with eager eyes fixed upon his
neighbor.</p>

<p>Again, alas! The miracles came not. Beards of
grizzly gray remained the same. Wrinkles did not disappear,
and stiffened joints still moved with the same
lack of spring as of yore. Alack and aday!! The
fountain had lost its charm and was not the fabled
water of perpetual youth.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the solemn voice of Father
Antonio:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“God’s will be done!” cried he. “Blessed be His
holy name!”</p>

<p>In sorrow and with downcast faces, the Spaniards
turned about, and wearily, dejectedly, mournfully,
wended their way back to the camp of the friendly
Olatheta.</p>

<p class="p2">The good Knight Ponce de Leon traveled through
much of this beautiful land of Florida, fought many a
stiff fight with the native inhabitants, and finally sailed
back to the isle of Porto Rico, bearing marvelous tales
of this land of promise, but no water which would
restore the agèd to youth and beauty. He journeyed
to Spain, was received right graciously by the
King, and came back to his island home, expecting
to remain there in peaceful pursuits, until his demise.</p>

<p>Yet, still hoping to find that mystical and fabled
fountain, he finally fitted out two caravels, and, with a
larger force than had followed his banner in the first
expedition, resolved to again explore the western coast
of beautiful Florida.</p>

<p>This journey was to be his undoing. At every point
naked savages fought desperately against his mailed
warriors. In one of these encounters he was attempting
to rescue one of his comrades, when he was hit by
an arrow in the thigh. The barb penetrated the protecting
armor to the bone. He was rescued by his
faithful followers and was carried to his ship, weak
and fainting from the loss of blood. It is said by some,
that, although the arrow was withdrawn, a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
arrow-head, which was of flint, did not come wholly
away.</p>

<p>Suffering and delirious, the brave old navigator was
borne to the harbor of Matanzas in Cuba, where was a
settlement which he, himself, had founded. His adventurous
companions lifted the pallet upon which he
lay on the upper deck, where the cooling breezes might
alleviate his fever, lowered it into a boat, and, when
the shore was reached, carried him tenderly into an
unfinished house, which he was having constructed.
They brought his suit of mail, his banner, and his
sword, placing them around him so that he might feel at
home. Delirium now seized the care-worn explorer,
and thus he lay for days, as, in fancy he saw himself a
boy again, climbing the bold rocks of the Sierras after
young eagles, contending in the courtyard with his
brothers, or chasing the brown deer in the leafy forests.</p>

<p>Then the camp and battle scenes passed before his
eager vision; voyages over vast seas among beauteous
islands; expeditions through palms and moss-grown
mimosas; journeying to the villages of brown-skinned
natives.</p>

<p>One night, peace came to the old warrior, and there
was weeping and sorrow among his staunch and battle-scarred
companions.</p>

<p>They carried the body of the good knight to the Isle
of Porto Rico, where they first gave him a sepulchre
within the castle, but eventually his ashes were deposited
beneath the high altar of the Dominican
church in San Juan de Puerto Rico, where they rested
for more than three hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When the American forces invaded the country in
1898, and took it away from the rule of Castile, his
remains were placed beneath a monument, upon which
was carved the trite but appropriate saying:</p>

<p>“This narrow grave contains the remains of a man
who was a lion by name, and much more so by nature.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">VASCO NUÑEZ DE BALBOA:</h2>

<p class="pch">DISCOVERER OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1475-1517)</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">IT is something to be a discoverer of anything. It
must give the one who has that happy fate a great
thrill of satisfaction. He should know that his
name will go down to history as a man of particular
eminence. Yet, do you think that any of these early
Spanish voyagers held that thought? I doubt whether
either De Soto, or Balboa, ever had any extraordinary
feeling of elation when they had feasted their eyes
upon the two great sheets of water, which, as far as we
know, they were the first white men to set eyes upon;
the first, the Mississippi; the second, the vast Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>Once I thought that I had discovered a wide plateau
upon the summit of the Rockies. I knew that I was
in an unexplored region which had never been mapped,
and, as I scrambled to a high eminence to look down
upon the headwater of a curving stream, I turned to
my companion, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“This is magnificent! We are turning our eyes
upon a scene of verdant beauty upon which no one but
the wild Cheyenne, or roving Blackfoot warrior has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gazed before! I feel thrilled! I feel awed! I feel
in the same way that Columbus must have felt,
when&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He saw that tomato can lying down there in that
sage bush,” interrupted my companion, dryly, and
sure enough&mdash;some accursed white man had been there
before me! It was a drop from the sublime to the
ridiculous!</p>

<p>But Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, when he stood upon
the shores of the Pacific, was aware that he was the first
Spaniard to set eyes upon this particular sheet of water,
because he had learned from the Indians that such an
ocean existed, and, so far, no explorer had yet come to
Spain who had brought word of it. The accounts of
the scene say that he was thrilled and awed by the
vision which came to him, and that, realizing, when
approaching the water, that he was about to view an
ocean which no other European had ever seen, he left
his party behind him, so that no one else should share
his honor. This shows a selfishness which is quite
characteristic of these early Spanish adventurers and
discoverers.</p>

<p>Balboa was not only selfish, but he was also daring.
He was likewise a fellow of considerable humor, as
the following incident will illustrate.</p>

<p>The adventurer and explorer was tall, red-headed
and athletic. He had come from a good family in
Spain, and, when a young man, had emigrated to the
New World, where he had settled as a farmer in Hispaniola.
Here he was soon overwhelmed with debt, as
he was loose and prodigal in his habits. His creditors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
pressed him severely and it came to be quite a problem
with him how to escape these persons who were hounding
his trail. But he was clever, and eluded their
watchfulness by having himself hauled in a cask from
his farm to a vessel, which was about to set sail. As
this barrel was supposed to contain provisions, he was
soon safely out to sea. The contents of that cask were
the most animated that the sailors had ever seen, and,
when the stowaway gained the deck, shouting: “Good
morning, Señors, I am going to be one of you henceforth,”
the Spanish stevedores nearly fainted from surprise.</p>

<p>In those days the Spaniards were continually making
new settlements near the Isthmus of Panama, and
the venturesome Balboa had fallen in with a body of
adventurers who settled at Darien, a native village upon
the east coast of the Isthmus and near a great bay.
There were many natives at this town when the Castilians
arrived, but, although they put up a sharp fight
in order to protect their village and their possessions,
they were routed by the navigators, who seized their
village, with a large quantity of food and cotton, and
also a great mass of gold ornaments, worth fifty thousand
dollars. This place seemed to be healthy and fertile,
so, from this time forth, it became the headquarters
of the Spaniards in the New World.</p>

<p>As has seemed to be perpetually the case in Spanish
America, when these settlers were not fighting Indians,
they were fighting among themselves. There were two
Governors in the country, at this period, who had the
sweet-sounding names of Encisco and Nicuesa, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is customary with Spanish-American potentates, they
were soon at daggers’ points with one another.</p>

<p>Balboa carefully stirred up the resentment between
them, hoping that there would come a revolution, after
which he would step into the Governorship, himself.
Encisco declared that he had control over the town and
citizens of Darien, but Balboa contented that Darien
was situated in the territory assigned to Nicuesa and
that Encisco had no authority there, whatsoever.
Stirred by the speeches of this cask-traveler, the Spanish
adventurers refused obedience to the pompous Encisco.</p>

<p>Some one, at this moment, sent to Nombre de Dios,
another settlement on the coast, and advised Nicuesa
to come down to Darien in order to act as Governor.
Balboa stirred up a revolution against him, while he
was on his way, declaring that his reputation was that
of a harsh administrator, that he ruled in a very high-handed
fashion, and that he would be a worse ruler
than Encisco.</p>

<p>The hot Spanish blood began to boil in the inhabitants
of Darien, and had soon boiled to such a pitch
that, when Nicuesa sailed into the harbor, he was greeted
by an angry rabble who yelled at him derisively, refused
to receive him as governor, and, when he attempted
to march into the city, attacked him with
swords and drove him into the woods.</p>

<p>To the credit of Balboa be it said that he now interceded
for the poor fellow, so that no actual harm was
done him, and, since he refused to return to Nombre
de Dios, he was presented with the worst vessel in the
harbor and the most unseaworthy, in which to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to Spain. This he did with a few faithful followers,
and was never heard of again in the New World.</p>

<p>Now see how the crafty Vasco Nuñez de Balboa profited
by this little revolution, for, having deposed one
of the governors, and having sent away the other, the
irascible inhabitants of the country chose Balboa and
a man named Lamudio to rule them as magistrates.</p>

<p>Encisco was, of course, furious at this and shortly
sailed to Spain in order to plead his own cause before
the King; but Balboa was not to be caught napping.
He dispatched his friend, Lamudio, along at the same
time in order to offset the pleas of the angry Encisco,
and, to further aid and abet his own cause, secretly
loaded him with a sound sum of gold with which to
ease the palm of the royal treasurer in old Madrid. He
was crafty, as you can well appreciate.</p>

<p>What do you think of this fellow now? From being
a mere stowaway, and an outcast who was hunted
by his creditors and head over heels in debt, this adventurous
Spaniard, at one bound had risen to be a governor
and commander of troops. And in this new rôle
he showed marked ability, for he not only led his men
well against the native chiefs, but also managed to gain
the confidence of these wild inhabitants of the Isthmus,
so that, one after another, they became his friends and
his allies.</p>

<p>Balboa kept up his expeditions into the unknown interior
and more than once was told that a vast ocean
lay beyond the mountains which jutted up from the
table-land of the central portion of this strip of country
between North and South America. Several natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
spoke of a gray, glittering body of water, quite different
from the Atlantic. The Indians said that “it was
far away,” so, as Balboa anticipated a long journey
to see and make certain of the native tales, he determined
to ask assistance from the King of Spain. In
spite of the fact that he was really a rebel and was
ruling over a colony of revolutionists, we find that he
actually did send a letter to Ferdinand, asking for a
thousand men to be dispatched to him, so that he might
undertake the discovery of this fabled ocean. He was
careful to send along some gold, for nothing spoke
more loudly with the Spanish sovereign than this.</p>

<p>The ambitious Balboa waited patiently for a reply
from far distant Spain; but, before it came, he received
a very disquieting epistle from Lamudio, his faithful
friend whom he had dispatched to court to plead his
cause. Alas! Ferdinand had heard the complaint of
the outraged Encisco and had given judgment in his
favor against the upstart and revolutionist, Nuñez de
Balboa. Worse yet! The adventurous Governor of
Darien was to be summoned to Spain in order that he
might answer to the King for his treatment of Nicuesa.</p>

<p>Balboa heard this with regret, also with some anger.
He was clever enough to see that only one course could
save him, and that was to act promptly, and at once;
to find this ocean, and to travel to Spain with the news
of this discovery, first hand. He knew King Ferdinand
well enough to believe that, if successful in this
venture, displeasure would be turned into favor. The
royal order had not yet come&mdash;he was still free&mdash;so
he determined to waste no moment in idleness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>This was to be no child’s play, for dense tropical
forests were in front of him; lofty mountain ranges;
and deep rivers. There were also vindictive Indian
tribes in the path, and warriors who had no love for
those mail-clad white-skins. Balboa had less than two
hundred soldiers and these were not properly armed,
yet, should he stay where he was, ruin stared him in
the face and disgrace confronted him. It was forward
and success, or a future of oblivion in old Madrid.</p>

<p>The morning of the first day of September, 1513,
dawned bright and sunny upon the harbor of Darien,
as a small fleet of vessels sailed away, with Balboa
in command. With them were several savage bloodhounds
with which to chase and terrorize the Indians,
and also a number of friendly natives who were to act
as guides and interpreters. The journey up the coast
was uneventful, and, having finally arrived at Coyba,
the domain of a friendly chief, the soldiers were disembarked,
the march was commenced, and all struck
off cheerfully towards the high mountains which could
be seen towering up in the interior. It was hot and
the men suffered from the torrid blaze, because of their
armor and steel caps.</p>

<p>Keeping on, and struggling through the tropic vegetation,
the expedition made good progress, and reached
a native village from which the inhabitants had fled
as soon as they had learned of the approach of these
adventurers. But it was quite necessary to obtain
guides who knew the wilderness in front, so Balboa sent
some of his Indians to find the chieftain, who had disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
from this pleasantly situated little collection
of huts. The chief was not far away and allowed the
native path-finders to approach without waylaying them.
He was later persuaded to visit the camp of the Spaniards,
and, after he had been feasted, consented to furnish
the eager Castilians with trained men who could
pilot them through the country.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, pointing to a lofty ridge, “is a
mountain from the top of which one may see the great
waters upon the other side.”</p>

<p>Balboa’s eyes sparkled, for he was now within striking
distance of his goal and he saw success written upon
the banner, which, waving aloft, carried the blazoned
arms of Castile. A number of the men were ill and
exhausted, so they were sent back. The remainder
were eager to get on, so, with renewed courage, the
Spaniards again pressed through the tropic foliage and
tangled undergrowth.</p>

<p>Advancing for about thirty miles, they came to the
territory of a chieftain who was a deadly enemy of the
native whose country they had just traversed. He attacked
the small Spanish band with vindictive fury.
The natives advanced with a great show of confidence,&mdash;yelling,
screeching, and discharging a veritable
shower of arrows. The first boom from the old-time
guns made them cease their yelping and stop still.
The Castilians now advanced for a little sword-work,
but they were to find no brave foe who would engage
in combat. The Indians fled. As they did so, the
bloodhounds were let go and many of the redskins were
overtaken and worried to death by these ferocious animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
In the native village was found a large quantity
of both gold and jewels.</p>

<p>Some of the Castilians had been struck by arrows,
so they were now left behind. The rest pressed on,
for they had reached the foot of the large mountain
from the top of which the friendly chief had declared
that one could view the vast expanse of water beyond.
All were cheerful and sang songs from old Madrid in
order to make the journey a more joyous one.</p>

<p>That night they camped near a spring of crystal water
and in the morning emerged from the forest at the foot
of an eminence from which their friends, the natives,
told them that they could see the ocean.</p>

<p>Now note how Balboa did the same thing which another
explorer was criticized for doing many years
later. He left his party behind, in order that no one
might share the honor of discovery, and climbed alone
to the mountain top. Up, up, he clambered, and at
last stood upon the summit. Hurrah! he had found
what he had suffered great hardship and privation
to find. There before his eager gaze lay another
ocean.</p>

<p>The adventurous explorer sank upon the soil and
feasted his eyes upon the scene. Beyond a wide, intervening
belt of rocks and forest, and seen through
the swaying branches of green savannah trees, was that
vast, mysterious ocean of which Columbus had heard,
but which no European had yet beheld. It lay there
gleaming, glistening, rising and falling, beckoning to
the adventurous to sail upon its surface and find danger,&mdash;and
treasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Balboa reclined there for a long time, dreaming,
speculating, and thanking his lucky star that he had
at last seen this once fabled sheet of water, for now he
could go before King Ferdinand and be sure of a cordial
reception. Then he arose and climbed down the
side of the mountain to where his followers lay drowsing.</p>

<p>“Come, men!” he cried. “I have found it, the Mal
de Sur (Southern Ocean).”</p>

<p>The men scrambled to the summit in no time, and,
when they, too, saw the gray, rolling billows, they set
up a wild cheering. The <i>Te Deum</i> was chanted, a cross
was erected, and, from this lofty eminence, Balboa
cried out that he took possession of this sheet of water,
with all of its islands and surrounding lands, in the
name of his master, the King of Spain. Then again
a hymn was sung and all clambered down to the lowland
where they feasted right merrily. It had been
an eventful hour for these hard-marching, hard-mannered
swashbucklers from Darien.</p>

<p>This was the twenty-sixth day of September, 1513,
a day to be long remembered by Balboa, for he felt a
great weight lifted from his shoulders as he thought of
that letter which Lamudio had sent all the way from
Spain. His men had taken twenty days in crossing a
strip of territory scarcely forty miles in width, so you
can well imagine how tangled must have been this
tropic underbrush. Yet, unmindful of their hardships,
they now set forth to journey to the very sea-coast,
and to there touch the water of this newly discovered
Mal de Sur.</p>

THE KING OF SPAIN</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The Castilians descended the slope of the high mountains
and sought for the rich kingdoms of which they
had heard the natives speak. But they found nothing
remarkable save some wild thickets and impenetrable
bogs.</p>

<p>Finally they passed through the territory of a warlike
chieftain who came out to stop their progress and
forbade them to set foot within his dominions. He
drew up his followers in close array, and seemed to be
quite willing to fight; but a volley from the arquebusiers
scattered his followers like chaff before the wind.
The chieftain soon gave himself up, and, in order to
gain the favor of the Spaniards, brought them a quantity
of gold. This pleased Balboa greatly and he tarried
in the native village for several days.</p>

<p>Then separate parties were dispatched to the sea
in order to find the best route by which it could be
approached. One of these bands, in which was a fellow
named Alonzo Martin, reached the water before
any one else, and at a place where were several canoes.
Alonzo jumped into one of these, and, pushing it into
the waves, cried out to his companions:</p>

<p>“See, my friends, I am the first European to ever
sail upon the new ocean.”</p>

<p>Balboa followed soon afterwards, and, taking a banner
upon which was painted a picture of the Virgin
and child, and under them the royal arms of Spain,
drew his sword, waded to his knees in the water, and
solemnly declared that this belonged to his sovereign,
together with all the adjacent lands from pole to pole,
as long as the world should endure and until the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
day of judgment. Then he came back to the beach
where his few followers cheered lustily.</p>

<p>The climate was hot and muggy, but the Spaniards
were keen and enterprising and soon had explored a
considerable area. The Indians were friendly and gave
them gifts of gold and pearls, of which a quantity was
set aside for shipment to Spain. Stories were told by
the natives of a country far to the south where was more
gold than could be ever seen in this particular land.
The chattering brown-skinned Indians also spoke of
animals, resembling a deer, which the southern people
used for transporting their luggage. They showed the
Spaniards a figure molded in clay which was said to
be the baggage-bearer of these natives to the south. It
seemed to be somewhat like a deer and somewhat like
a camel in appearance, in fact, was the llama, which
Pizarro later came upon in far-distant Peru. The
tales of this country and these animals stirred up
many thoughts in the active mind of Balboa, and he
conceived the idea of sailing to that mysterious realm
and taking possession of it, even as he had seized the
Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p>The Spaniards had now seen about all that was to be
seen, and it was time to march across the mountains
towards Darien. With their usual cheerfulness the
adventurers started for their home port, carrying along
a great quantity of gold and pearls, and also a stock
of provisions, which was transported by friendly natives.
But, as they tramped into the country, they secured
more gold, and, because they loaded the Indians
with this instead of with food, they came near dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of hunger. They met many hostile chiefs, among whom
was a fellow who had eighty wives. He was called
Tubanama, and, although he put up a stiff fight for his
freedom, he was captured. His people ransomed him
by means of many golden ornaments, and, thus appeased,
the Castilians marched onward, naming this
country Panama, after the wily chieftain.</p>

<p>Balboa was now prostrated by fever and had to be
borne along in a hammock by the natives. The heat
and humidity of the swampy country caused many of
his followers to become ill and this delayed the march.
Still, the little caravan kept on, and, on the eighteenth
day of January, reached Darien, after an absence of
four and a half months in this journey of exploration.
The entire population turned out to welcome the discoverer
of the Pacific, who returned laden with pearls,
golden ornaments and plates of embossed silver. There
was also a long train of captive natives who followed in
the rear. The trip had been a glorious success and all
cheered lustily for Balboa: adventurer, explorer, and
first European to view the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The time was now opportune for a missive to the
King of Spain, for the adventurous explorer knew that
Ferdinand would not oust a man from office who had
added such a vast domain to his possessions. So he
dispatched a special envoy to Madrid, with a letter
which gave a full account of this overland journey. He
also added a gift of glittering pearls and one-fifth of
the gold which he had secured, this being the regular
tax which the Spanish government imposed upon all
its subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The vessel was delayed in sailing, and the delay was
fatal, for the King of Spain had resolved to appoint
another Governor of Panama in place of Balboa, as
he had listened to the story of Encisco and had decided
that he had been very unjustly treated by this upstart
from Hispaniola, who had escaped from his debtors in
a cask. A man named Pedrarias had been selected for
the post and he was already on his way, accompanied
by a host of adventurers who had heard that Darien
was a country of enormous wealth. There were, in
fact, fully two thousand men, who were eager for adventure
in this new-found territory.</p>

<p>Pedrarias, with his many followers, had scarcely
put to sea, before a ship sailed into the harbor of Seville
bearing the envoy from Balboa. He delivered his letters
to Ferdinand, told him of the discovery of this
wonderful new ocean, and presented the King with the
golden vessels and trinkets which his faithful subject
had sent him.</p>

<p>The King opened his eyes in wonder and surprise.
Why, he might have made an error after all! This fellow
was a pretty good sort,&mdash;a discoverer of new
territory, of a new ocean, indeed. He had also sent
him considerable treasure. Well! Well! Well! The
King decided that he had acted somewhat hastily. He
would send another missive to far-off Darien, and would
make the excellent Balboa a colleague of Pedrarias, and
entitled to equal honor. That would be proper recognition
for all that this man had done for the crown of
Castile and should satisfy him, without a doubt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pedrarias was sailing towards the Isthmus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and eventually landed at Darien, where, at the head of
two thousand men in gorgeous array, he made a triumphant
entry into the town.</p>

<p>The cavaliers from Spain had expected to find a brilliant
city, with food in abundance and treasure piled
high on every side. Instead of this they found Balboa
wearing a cotton suit and a Panama hat. His five hundred
seasoned veterans were clad in loose cotton clothes,
and were living in straw-thatched cabins on roots and
cassava-bread. They also had no wine, but were drinking
water.</p>

<p>The newcomers were grievously disappointed at what
they found here in the colony. The climate was hot
and sticky and fever soon carried off a score of victims.
Others sickened and died of various complaints,
so that, within a very short time, seven hundred of
these dashing cavaliers had passed to the great beyond.
A ship-load of the gay blades now sailed back to Spain,
for they had seen all that they desired of this new
country. Another ship-load soon followed them to
Cuba.</p>

<p>Several expeditions were sent into the interior after
gold, but they suffered ill fortune. One of these parties
was defeated by the warlike chieftain Tubanama.
Another small army, sent out by Pedrarias, was overwhelmed
and butchered to a man: only one small Indian
boy escaping to tell the tale of the massacre. The
friends of Balboa began to murmur against this newly-appointed
Governor and to cry out, that, should their
own leader be in control, there would be no such disasters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Pedrarias realized that his own position was getting
to be insecure, and decided that he had better form
an alliance with Balboa by giving him one of his daughters
in marriage. He suggested this to his rival and
the other accepted the offer gladly. Thus a written
agreement was drawn up and signed by both parties
whereby the young lady was to be joined in wedlock to
Balboa just as soon as she could be brought from Spain.
All now looked favorable for a peaceful rule in the
Isthmus.</p>

<p>Balboa’s restless mind soon conceived the idea of
another expedition,&mdash;or: a second journey to the Pacific
coast. This he wished to explore, and, since there
were no vessels upon the other side of the mountains,
nor could he build any, should he attempt the feat, he
decided to cut and shape the timbers on the Atlantic
coast and to transport them across the Isthmus to the
Pacific. A worthy undertaking and one which took
great courage and perseverance! Let us see how it
came out!</p>

<p>The Spaniards set diligently to work and soon had
shaped the timbers for two brigantines, with all the
necessary spars and rigging. It was a stupendous undertaking
to transport these to the other shore, yet the
feat was accomplished. The timbers were carried over
the mountains by the miserable natives, who had been
enslaved by the greedy Castilians, and they did good
work. Although hundreds perished on the journey,
the fact gave their master little concern.</p>

<p>Finally the caravan had arrived upon the Pacific
coast, the ships were put together, and floated upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
waters of the new-found ocean. Hurray! The first
European vessel had been launched upon the far away
Pacific and the proud flag of Spain floated from her
masthead.</p>

<p>Balboa and his compatriots boarded their ships and
headed south, bound to sail to that far distant land of
which the natives had told him. But stormy winds
were met with, so the men put back, sailed to the
point which they had started from, and determined to
make two more vessels before they would again depart
for the land of the llama and glittering gold. Alas!
busy tongues had been working against Balboa since
he had left Darien and it was to go ill with this intrepid
explorer.</p>

<p>The vessels were greatly in need of iron and of pitch,
so it was decided to send across the mountains for these.
Balboa, himself accompanied his men, and, as he advanced
through the forest, was met by a messenger who
presented a letter from Governor Pedrarias. It was
couched in the friendliest of terms and bade him come
at once to Darien in order to confer with him upon
matters of the utmost importance. Balboa smiled, for
matters were apparently going well with him.</p>

<p>The weak old Governor, however, had been stirred
up by the enemies of the discoverer of the Pacific, to
such a point, that he was in a fit of jealous rage. Some
had told him that Balboa had no intention of marrying
his daughter, as he was about to take unto himself
an Indian girl as wife. Others whispered that he and
his men were about to start an independent government
on the Pacific coast and throw off their allegiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the Spanish crown. Pedrarias determined to arrest
this successful adventurer as soon as he should arrive.</p>

<p>Balboa, meanwhile, was approaching the Atlantic
sea-coast with a light heart, and a feeling that all would
go well with him. What was his surprise when he was
met by a cavalier called Pizarro, with an armed force,
and was told that, by orders of the Governor, he was
a prisoner. Yet he submitted quietly and was taken
to Darien in irons. There he found that the irascible
Governor had determined to try him for treason, and,
if he could, to do away with him.</p>

<p>A trial was soon held, and the venturesome navigator
was charged with treasonable intentions. There
was no evidence against him that was not trumped-up
for the occasion, yet he pleaded his innocence in
vain.</p>

<p>“How preposterous is this charge of my determination
to usurp the power here,” said he. “I have four
vessels and three hundred devoted followers upon the
other coast. Should I have so wished, I could have
sailed away far beyond the Governor’s reach, and could
have founded a colony of mine own in far-distant Peru.
My coming here is good evidence that I had no desire
to disobey the summons of the Governor. I am innocent
of these so-called offenses.”</p>

<p>In spite of all that he could say, the judges found
him guilty, yet recommended mercy because of his
wonderful discoveries and evident patriotism for Spain.
The Governor, however, would entertain no suggestion
of this nature.</p>

<p>“If he is guilty, let him die, and the sooner the better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>”
said the irate Pedrarias, scowling. “To the block
with him!”</p>

<p>So they took brave Balboa out and beheaded him in
spite of all the renown which he had won. The discoverer
of the Pacific met his end with calm indifference,
and, as the news of this was borne to the people
of Darien, many wept tears for the man who had
founded their city and had brought much honor to the
Spanish flag. Thus, in the very prime of his manhood,
perished one of the greatest explorers which the world
has produced, and, although he was foully and brutally
murdered by his own people, his fame will last as long
as men love those of courage, of daring, and of imagination.</p>

<h2 class="p4">HERNANDO CORTÉS:</h2>

<p class="pch">CONQUEROR OF MEXICO.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1485-1547)</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">TO the brave belong the spoils. To him, who ventures
much, sometimes comes a great reward.</p>

<p>Here is the story of a man who determined
to conquer an empire with but a handful of followers,&mdash;and
accomplished his purpose. Although it seems to
be a romance, it is a series of facts. Strange, wonderful,
almost unbelievable, yet true; for truth, they say,
is sometimes stranger than fiction. Listen, then, to
this tale of as valiant a soul as ever led fighting men on
to victory!</p>

<p>Long, long ago, when fat King Henry the Eighth
ruled over Merrie England, and Charles the Fifth was
King of Spain, there lived a young Spanish cavalier
called Hernando Cortés. He was a wild youth and did
not care for books or study. In fact, although his
parents wished him to be a lawyer and, when he was
fourteen years of age, sent him to an excellent school,
he would not learn his lessons and so was asked to leave
the institution. Returning home, he greatly annoyed
his good father and mother by cutting up and playing
all kinds of pranks, so that they were glad to learn he
had determined to join an expedition which was setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
out for that New World so lately discovered by Columbus.</p>

<p>Shortly after this decision he fell from the top of
a high wall, upon which he had been climbing after
wild grapes, and hurt himself so grievously that he
could not walk. It was therefore impossible for him
to join the adventurers who were heading for the New
World. The ship set sail without him.</p>

<p>For two years longer, young Cortés remained at
home, and then, finding that another expedition was
about to set sail, he obtained permission to join this
fleet, bound for the West Indies. He was now nineteen
years of age and was extremely agile and sinewy.
His face was pale, his eyes piercing, and his hair raven
black. He was looking for adventure and was determined
to bear himself right valiantly in whatever situation
he should find himself.</p>

<p>The fleet set sail, and arrived without accident at
Hispaniola. Cortés went immediately to see the Governor
of the island, whom he had known in Spain.</p>

<p>“You must remain here and become a good citizen,”
said the Spanish dignitary to him. “I will therefore
present you with a grant of land which I hope that you
will cultivate.”</p>

<p>“I came to get gold, not to till the ground like a
peasant,” said Cortés. “And I am anxious for adventure.”</p>

<p>The Governor laughed.</p>

<p>“You had better become a farmer,” said he.
“There is more money in crops than there is in searching
for gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Six years passed, six rather monotonous years for
Cortés, although he occasionally joined some expeditions
against the natives, where he learned how to endure
toil and danger, and became familiar with the
tactics of Indian warfare. At length, in 1511, when
Diego Velasquez, the Governor’s Lieutenant, undertook
the conquest of Cuba, Cortés gladly became one of his
followers, and, throughout the expedition, conducted
himself right valiantly.</p>

<p>The Spaniards conquered the country; but when,
later on, there was distribution of lands and of offices,
great discontent arose. Those who believed that they
had been ill-used, chose Cortés to journey back to Hispaniola
and lay their grievances before the higher authorities.
This reached the ears of Velasquez. He ordered
that the youthful Cortés should be bound, loaded
with fetters, and thrown into prison. The act was
humiliating, but it was what those of Spanish blood
were accustomed to do to one another. Note, however,
how the young man conducted himself!</p>

<p>Cortés soon succeeded in escaping from the irons
which encircled him, and, letting himself down from the
window of the jail, took refuge in the nearest church,
where he claimed that he could not be touched, as he
was under the protection of the priests. Velasquez
heard of this, was very angry, and stationed a guard
near the sanctuary, with orders to seize the youthful
Spaniard, should he endeavor to get off. Cortés was
careless, wandered, one day, quite far from the church
door, and was immediately captured.</p>

<p>Velasquez determined to get rid of the young adventurer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
this time, so had him carried on board a ship
which was to sail, next day, for Hispaniola. But
Cortés was again too clever for him. By great exertion
he managed to drag his feet through the rings
which fettered him, and, dropping silently over the side
of the ship into a little boat, made off in the darkness.</p>

<p>As he neared the shore, the water became so rough
that the boat was useless, so he dove overboard and swam
the rest of the way. He was tossed up upon the beach
in a half-dazed condition; but finally arose, made his
way to the church, and hid himself in the sanctuary.
Velasquez had no idea where he had disappeared to.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the bold adventurer married a lady
named Catalina Xuarez whose family was friendly
with the hard-hearted Velasquez. Peace was therefore
made with the Governor, and Cortés received a large
estate near St. Iago, where he lived for some years
and even amassed a considerable sum of money.</p>

<p>Here he was quietly residing when news came of
an exploring expedition which had set out in 1518 to
find out what lay farther to the west. It had been led
by Grijalva, a nephew of Velasquez, and he had touched
at various places on the coast of Mexico. This was a
land inhabited by Indians called Aztecs who had named
their country after “Mexitili”: war god of their race.</p>

<p>These Aztecs, it seems, had originally come down
from the north, and, after many wanderings, had halted
on the western border of a great lake which lay in a
long valley, situated at a height of about 7,500 feet
above the sea, so that the air was cool even in the hottest
weather. The valley, sixty odd miles in width, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
surrounded by towering rocks which were a protection
from invasion.</p>

<p>The Aztecs were few in numbers when they first
came to the shores of the lake, but they increased rapidly
in population and in power. Nearby were other
Indian tribes, and, as there was much warfare between
them, the Aztecs united themselves with the King of
the Tezcucans in order to aid him against a tribe called
the Tepanics, who had invaded his territory. The allies
won, and, as a result, an agreement was made between
the states of Mexico, Tezcuco, and Tlacopan,
that they should support one another in the wars and
divide all the spoils between them. This alliance remained
unbroken for over a hundred years.</p>

<p>Although fond of warfare and cruel in their tortures
to prisoners, the Aztecs had many wise laws and
institutions, and were, in some respects, highly civilized.
They were governed by an Emperor, and, when he died,
another one was chosen by four nobles from among his
sons or nephews. The one preferred was obliged to
have distinguished himself in war, and he was not
crowned until he had waged a successful campaign,
had captured large numbers of the enemy, and thus
provided enough captives to grace his entry into the
capital.</p>

<p>The Aztecs worshiped thirteen principal gods, and
more than two hundred of less importance, whose temples
were everywhere to be seen. At the head of all
the gods was the great Huitzilopochtli, whose temples
were in every city of the empire, and whose image was
always loaded with costly ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>They also had a legend that there had once dwelt upon
the earth the great god, Quetzalcoatl, god of the air,
under whose sway the Aztec people had flourished and
there had been peace and prosperity among all men.
He was said to have been tall in stature, with a white
skin, long, dark hair, and a flowing beard. He had,
in fact, quite resembled a Spaniard, and this led to the
success which Cortés had with the Mexicans, as you
will presently see.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl, it was said, had in some way incurred
the wrath of the principal gods, so that he had been
forced to leave the country. He had turned towards
the Gulf of Mexico, had stopped at the city of Cholula,
and had then departed in a magic boat, made of serpent’s
skins, to the fabled land of Tlapallan. Tradition
had it that as he was leaving, he had turned to
the faithful ones who had followed him saying: “Watch
and wait for me, I shall come again.” For this reason
the Aztecs were ever on the lookout for the great and
benevolent god of the white skin and flowing beard.</p>

<p>As horses were not known, communication was held
by means of couriers, who, trained from childhood to
run, traveled with amazing swiftness. There were relay
stations, or post houses, for these couriers, and they
would thus carry on their messages for a hundred to
two hundred miles in a day. In this manner the Emperor
of the Aztecs, as he sat in his palace in the City
of Mexico, would feast upon fresh fish, which, twenty-four
hours before, had been caught in the Gulf of
Mexico, over two hundred miles away. Thus the news
was transmitted when war was in progress, and, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
messengers came along the highways, the people knew
whether the tidings were good or bad, by the dress which
they wore. If bad news, the runners were in black.
If good, in gay colors.</p>

<p>The one great object of all expeditions made by the
Aztecs was to capture victims to be sacrificed upon their
altars. They believed that the soldier who fell in battle
was transported at once to the blissful regions of
the sun, and consequently they fought with an utter
disregard for danger. The dress of the warriors was
magnificent. Their bodies were protected by a belt
of quilted cotton, impervious to all darts or arrows, and
over this the chiefs wore mantles of gorgeous feather-work.
Their helmets were made of wood, fashioned
so as to resemble the head of some wild animal, and
embellished with bits of gold and of silver. Their banners
were embroidered with gold and with feather-work.</p>

<p>After the prisoners had been brought from the battle
field they were sacrificed to the gods in a most brutal
and horrible manner. The poor victim was held by
five priests upon a huge, round, sacrificial stone; while
a sixth butcher, clothed in a scarlet mantle, plunged a
long knife into the breast of the writhing captive, and,
cutting out the heart, held it up first to the sun, which
they worshiped, and then cast it at the feet of the stone
god. The dagger used was as sharp as a razor and
made of “itztli,” a volcanic substance as hard as flint.
This was not all. The body of the captive thus sacrificed
was afterwards given to the warrior who had
taken him in battle, who thereupon gave a great banquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and served him up among choice dishes and delicious
beverages, for the entertainment of his friends.</p>

<p>The Aztecs called their temples, <i>teocallis</i>, which
means, “Houses of God,” and there were several hundred
of them in each of the principal cities. They
looked like Egyptian pyramids, and were divided into
four or five stories, each one smaller than the one below
it. The ascent was by a flight of steps. At the
top was a broad space on which stood a tower, from
forty to fifty feet high, which contained the images of
the gods. Before such a tower was the stone of sacrifice
and two lofty altars on which the sacred fires
burned continually. The floor was dyed crimson
from the blood of the helpless victims of the Aztec
wars.</p>

<p>These people were unknown to the Spaniards, at this
time, since of them Grijalva sent back to Cuba only a
few vague reports. It was said, however, that the country
was full of gold and of treasure.</p>

<p>When this news reached the ears of Cortés he was
immediately fired with a resolve to penetrate into this
unknown land and to gain great renown for himself.
The Governor of Cuba, likewise, determined to send
out ships in order to follow up the discoveries of
Grijalva. Who should be put in command? Who was
better, indeed, than Hernando Cortés!</p>

<p>The Spanish adventurer, with the utmost energy,
at once began to purchase and to fit out ships. He used
all the money that he had saved and as much as he
could persuade his friends to lend him, so that it was
not long before he was in possession of six vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
while three hundred recruits had signified their intention
of sailing with him.</p>

<p>But now the Spanish nature began to assert itself,
for a jealousy and distrust of Cortés took possession
of the mind of Velasquez and he determined to entrust
the fleet to the hands of some one else. This would
have put an end to the aspirations of the youthful
leader, had it not been whispered to him that Velasquez
was about to have him removed from his place. He
took care to checkmate the plans of his former enemy.
Summoning his officers secretly, he set sail that very
night with what supplies he was able to put his hands
on, although his ships were neither ready for a voyage,
nor properly provisioned.</p>

<p>Morning dawned and Velasquez heard that the fleet
was under weigh. He rose hastily, galloped to the
ocean, and found Cortés in a small boat drifting near
the shore. The commander of the expedition rowed
back to within speaking distance.</p>

<p>“This is a courteous way of taking leave of me,
truly,” cried the angry Governor.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” answered the young mariner. “Time
presses and there are some things which should be done
even before they are thought of. Good-bye, my friend;
may you live to see the day when I return a great
man.”</p>

<p>With that he paddled to the fleet and ordered all
hands to sail away. This was November the 18th.,
1518.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the vessels anchored off Trinidad,
a town on the southern coast of Cuba. Here Cortés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
landed, set up his standard, and invited all, who wished
to join the expedition, to come on with him. He told
them that there was great wealth to be gained and attracted
many volunteers to his banner. Finally, in
February, he had sufficient reënforcements assembled,
so he set sail. He had eleven vessels, one hundred and
ten sailors, five hundred and fifty-three soldiers, and
two hundred Indians. He likewise had sixteen horses,
ten large guns, and four falconets, or light cannon.</p>

<p>The fleet set out, touched upon the coast in several
places, and then reached the mouth of the Rio de
Tabasco. The Spaniards landed and found that the
Indians were hostile and were drawn up in great force
against them. But Cortés had his cannon put ashore,
ordered an attack, and soon had captured both the town
of Tabasco and also many of the Indians, who saw the
uselessness of further fighting, and consequently came
humbly to the Spaniards, bringing presents and slaves.
Among the latter was a beautiful Mexican girl called
Malinche who had fallen into the hands of the cacique
of Tabasco through some traders, to whom she had been
sold by her mother. The Spaniards always called her
Marina, and, as she quickly learned to speak their
language, she was soon of inestimable assistance to them
as an interpreter. Cortés made her his secretary and
always kept her near him in the exciting days which
followed.</p>

<p>By means of his interpreter, Cortés found that these
Indians were the subjects of the emperor Montezuma,
and were governed by Tenhtlile, one of the great nobles.
He determined to send word to the potentate who ruled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
over this country and to let him know that he and his
followers wished to see him.</p>

<p>Upon the day following, Tenhtlile arrived at the
Spanish camp, accompanied by a numerous retinue.
The Indian chieftain asked about the country of the
strangers and the object of their visit.</p>

<p>“We are subjects of a powerful monarch beyond
the seas,” replied the leader of the adventurers, “who
has heard of the greatness of your Mexican Emperor
and has sent me with a present to be delivered to him
in person, as a token of his good will. I would be glad,
therefore, to go immediately to his capital and trust
that you can guide me there.”</p>

<p>This seemed to annoy the Aztec noble, for he replied
in a haughty manner:</p>

<p>“How is it that you have been here only two days,
and yet demand to see my Emperor? I am surprised
to learn that there lives another monarch as powerful
as Montezuma, but, if it is true that you are his representative,
I will communicate with my Emperor and
will forward to him the royal present sent by you.
Meanwhile, pray receive the gifts which I have brought
for you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a number of slaves came forward and
deposited ten loads of gorgeous feather-work, and a
wicker basket filled with golden ornaments.</p>

<p>Cortés was greatly pleased with this show of friendliness,
and ordered his own soldiers to bring forth the
presents for Montezuma. These were an armchair
richly carved and painted, a crimson cloth cap with a
gold medal, and a quantity of collars, bracelets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
other ornaments of cut glass, which much surprised
the Aztecs, as this was a country where there was no
glass, and hence these were more valuable than emeralds
or sapphires.</p>

<p>“I see over there a soldier with a shining thing upon
his head,” now said Tenhtlile. “I should much like
to send that to Montezuma, for it will remind him of
the one worn by the god Quetzalcoatl. Can I not have
it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Cortes, “and I trust that you
will ask the Emperor to return it filled with the gold
dust of the country, so that I may compare it with that
which is in mine own. If you must know it, my kind
friend, we Spaniards are troubled with a disease of the
heart for which gold is the only sure remedy. I trust,
therefore, that you will send us all that you can.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Cortés observed that one of
the Indians was busy with a pencil, and, on looking at
his work, saw that he had made a sketch of the Spaniards,
their costumes, and weapons. This was the celebrated
picture writing, for which the Aztecs were famous.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Tenhtlile, “the Emperor can thus
get an excellent idea of you and your followers.”</p>

<p>“Bring out the cavalry,” cried Cortes, at this. “We
will show you our wonderful horses.”</p>

<p>The appearance of the snorting steeds filled the natives
with astonishment, and, when the General ordered
a cannon to be fired off, the natives ran away in alarm.
The painters, however, were very busy, and faithfully
recorded everything which the Spaniards possessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
even putting in a picture of the ships as they swung
at anchor.</p>

<p>At length the Aztecs departed, with much bowing
and scraping. Their chief, Tenhtlile, seemed to be in
a good humor and left orders with his people to supply
the Spanish general with all that he might require until
further instructions from the Emperor Montezuma.</p>

<p>Meanwhile great excitement was taking place in the
Mexican capital, for many seemed to think that the
great god, Quetzalcoatl, had returned to earth and was
about to revisit the scenes of his former life. Montezuma,
himself, seemed to be undecided how to act.
When the picture writings, showing the Spanish invaders,
reached him, he summoned the Kings of Tezcuco
and Tlacopan in order to consult with them as to how
the strangers should be received. The three differed
in their ideas, but finally Montezuma resolved to send a
rich present to Cortés which would impress him with a
high idea of the Emperor’s wealth and his grandeur.
At the same time he determined to forbid him to approach
the capital.</p>

<p>Eight days passed away&mdash;eight long days for
Cortés and his men, as they were suffering greatly
from the intense heat&mdash;and then the embassy, accompanied
by the governor, Tenhtlile, arrived at the
camp, and presented Cortés with the magnificent presents
sent by Montezuma.</p>

<p>After the usual salute, the slaves unrolled some delicately
woven mats and displayed the gifts which the
Aztec Emperor had sent. There were shields, helmets,
and cuirasses embossed with plates and ornaments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pure gold; with collars and bracelets of the same precious
metal. There were also sandals, fans, plumes,
and crests of variegated feathers, wrought with gold
and silver thread, and sprinkled with pearls and with
precious stones. There were golden birds and animals;
curtain coverlets and robes of cotton. There were more
than thirty loads of cotton cloth, and finally, the helmet
which Cortés had sent, loaded to the brim with
grains of pure gold.</p>

<p>This rich treasure fired the zeal and ardor of the
Spaniards; yet they controlled themselves, and expressed
admiration only for two circular plates of gold
and of silver as large as carriage wheels. One, representing
the sun, was richly carved with plants and with
animals, and was worth a fabulous sum of money.</p>

<p>When the voyageurs had received the presents, the
ambassadors courteously delivered their message, to the
effect that Montezuma had great pleasure in holding
communication with such a powerful monarch as the
King of Spain; but could grant no personal interview
to his soldiers. That the way to the capital was too
long and dangerous for the white men to attempt.
Therefore the strangers must return to the land from
which they had come.</p>

<p>Cortés received this message with coldness, and, turning
to his officers, said:</p>

<p>“This is, indeed, a rich and powerful Monarch, and
he does well to speak in this manner; but I am determined
to visit him in his capital.”</p>

<p>He then bade good-by to the Aztec ambassadors, who
shortly withdrew. That night every neighboring hut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was deserted by the natives, and the Spaniards were
left quite alone in the wilderness. They prepared for
an attack, but none came.</p>

<p>The soldiers now became mutinous, saying that it was
about time they returned with what treasure they had
already collected. Cortés had difficulty in keeping
them out of the boats, but now an event occurred which
aided him very materially in his design to march to
the City of Mexico, a design which he had long ago determined
upon.</p>

<p>Five Indians entered the camp who wore rings of
gold and bright blue gems in their ears and nostrils.
A gold leaf, delicately wrought, was attached to their
under lip. These were not Aztecs and explained that
they came from Cempoalla, the capital of a tribe called
the Totonacs, who had been lately conquered by the
Aztecs, and who greatly resented the oppressions of
these bloodthirsty tribesmen. The fame of the Spaniards,
said they, had reached their leader, who had sent
them to request the strangers to visit him, and to aid
him in throwing off the domination of the Aztecs.</p>

<p>It can be easily seen that Cortés was delighted to
hear this. He saw that discontent in the provinces
conquered by Montezuma could be turned to his own
advantage, and that, by allying himself to these Totonacs,
he might be able to conquer Montezuma himself.
He therefore dismissed the tribesmen with many
presents, promising that he would soon visit their city.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, the army set out to march northward,
to a place where it had been decided to build a
town. The men crossed a river in rafts and broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
canoes, which they found on the bank, and soon came to
a very different kind of country than that which they
had left behind them. There were wide plains covered
with green grass and groves of palm trees, among which
were deer and flocks of pheasants and wild turkeys.
The trees were loaded with fruits and with beautiful
clusters of bowers, while gayly plumaged birds fluttered
in the branches. There were gardens and orchards
on either side of the road. As the Spanish soldiers
passed along, they were met by crowds of friendly
natives, who mingled fearlessly with the soldiers, and
hung garlands of flowers around the neck of the General’s
horse.</p>

<p>The cacique, or chief of the Totonacs, received
Cortés with great courtesy, and assigned his soldiers to
a neighboring temple, where they were well supplied
with provisions. Cortés, himself, was presented with
several vessels of gold and robes of fine cotton.</p>

<p>Upon the following day the General paid the cacique
a visit, and, with the aid of Marina, held a long talk
with him. He promised to aid the Totonacs against
Montezuma. This pleased the chief greatly, and he
promised to assist the Spaniards in every way that he
could. Cortés returned to his troops, ordered an advance,
and soon reached the town of Chiahuitztla, which
stood upon a crag overlooking the valley.</p>

<p>As the Spaniards were halted in the center of the
village, five men entered the market place where they
were standing. Their dark, glossy hair was tied in a
knot upon the top of their heads, and they carried
bunches of sweet-smelling flowers in their hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Their attendants bore wands, or fans, to sweep away
the flies and insects from their lordly masters, who, by
their disdainful looks, showed that they considered
themselves to be superior to all around them. They
brushed by the Spaniards, scarcely seeming to notice
them, and were immediately joined by the Totonac
chiefs, who seemed anxious to gain their favor. Cortés
was much astonished, and, turning to Marina,
asked what this meant.</p>

<p>“These are Aztec nobles,” the girl replied, “and
they are empowered to receive tribute for Montezuma.”</p>

<p>“What are they saying?” asked he.</p>

<p>“They bring word that Montezuma is very angry
with the Totonacs for entertaining you and your men
without his permission,” Marina replied. “And, as
a punishment, he has demanded twenty young men and
maidens to be sacrificed to the gods.”</p>

<p>Cortés was much irritated by this and told the Totonacs
that they should not only refuse this demand
but should seize the Aztec nobles and throw them into
prison. This was done, but Cortés had the true Spanish
character and now played a part of duplicity
which was characteristic of the men from Seville. He
had two of the captured Aztecs released, brought them
before him, and very cunningly led them to believe that
he was sorry to learn that they had been thrown into
jail. He told them that he would help them to escape,
and begged them to tell Montezuma that the great Emperor
was held in high regard by the Spaniards. The
two nobles were then hastily dispatched to the port
where lay the Spanish vessels. They were taken on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
board, landed secretly upon the coast, and allowed to
depart for the court of Montezuma. The Totonacs were
very angry when they found that two of their prisoners
had escaped, and determined to sacrifice the remainder;
but Cortés interfered, had them taken to his vessels, and
soon allowed them to join their companions. In this
way he secured the friendship of Montezuma, while
still appearing as the friend of the Totonacs.</p>

<p>Messengers were sent to all the other Totonac cities,
telling the natives of the defiance that had been shown
the Emperor, and bidding them, also, to refuse to pay
tribute to Montezuma. The Indians soon came flocking
into the town in order to confer with the powerful
strangers, and thus Cortes managed to embroil them
with the Emperor. At the same time he made them all
swear allegiance to the Spanish King.</p>

<p>The Spaniards now busied themselves in building a
town, for they had to have some place to store their
belongings and also to retreat to in case of disaster.
The Indians helped them willingly, so they soon had an
excellent little village: the first one in new Spain.</p>

<p>When the Aztec nobles who had been set free reached
the city of Mexico, and told Montezuma of the treatment
which they had received, the Emperor of the Aztecs
felt rather kindly disposed towards the Spaniards,
and sent an embassy consisting of two young nephews
and four of his chief nobles. They bore a princely gift
of gold, richly embroidered cotton mantles, and robes
of feather work. On coming before Cortés, the envoys
presented Montezuma’s thanks to him for the courtesy
he had shown the captive nobles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“We believe that you are the long-looked-for strangers
who are to return with the god Quetzalcoatl,” said
the ambassadors, “and are therefore of the same lineage
as ourselves. Therefore, out of deference to you,
we will spare the Totonacs; but our day of vengeance
against them will soon come.”</p>

<p>Nothing was said about not being allowed to journey
to the capital, so Cortés gave these Aztecs presents, as
usual, and told them that he intended to soon visit
Montezuma in the city of Mexico, when all misunderstanding
between them would be adjusted. The Totonacs
were amazed and awed by the influence which the
Spaniards seemed to exert upon the Aztecs, and felt
safe from further incursions by the terrible Emperor.</p>

<p>The bold and resolute Cortés was now determined to
march to Mexico City, itself, to oust Montezuma, and
to obtain possession of his country and his treasures.
But he knew that the Governor of Cuba was his enemy,
and also knew that, should he not send news of his
discoveries to the King of Spain, he would be seriously
interfered with by Velasquez. Consequently he prepared
a letter setting forth the extent and magnitude
of his discoveries, gave up all his own treasure which he
had obtained from the natives, and persuaded his soldiers
to do the same. This was placed in the hands
of some of his followers who were given a ship, were
bidden god-speed, and were told to sail to Spain.
Cortés besought the King to make him Governor over
all the new territory, so that he could add the great
Indian Empire to the possessions of the Spanish crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Very soon after the departure of the treasure ship,
Cortés discovered that there was a conspiracy among
his followers, who had seized one of the ships, had
stored provisions and water on board, and were just
about to set sail for Cuba. One of the traitors repented
of the part he had taken in the plot, betrayed it to
Cortés, and thus made evident the extent of the conspiracy.
In consequence, the ringleaders were hanged,
and the Spanish commander determined to take the
bold step of destroying the ships without the knowledge
of his army. Accordingly he marched his entire
force to Cempoalla, where he told his plan to a few of
his devoted adherents, who approved of it. Nine of
the ships were sunk; after the sails, masts, iron, and all
movable fittings had been brought ashore.</p>

<p>When this act became known, it caused the greatest
consternation among the Spaniards. They murmured
loudly, and mutiny was threatened. Cortés,
however, was equal to the emergency. He managed
to reassure them, to persuade them that he had only
done what was best for them, and so cleverly told them
of the fame and treasure which they were on the eve of
gaining, that not one of them accepted the chance of
returning to Cuba in the remaining ship.</p>

<p>August the sixteenth, 1519, was a day ushered in
by brilliant sunshine, as if the fates were friendly to
the daring Spanish adventurer. Cortés was now ready
to advance into the interior, for he had obtained from
the cacique of Cempoalla, thirteen hundred warriors
and a thousand porters to carry his baggage and drag
onward the guns. His own force amounted to four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hundred foot and fifteen horses, with seven pieces of
artillery. Surely a small and insignificant army with
which to attempt to conquer this vast and populous
land!</p>

<p>The army set out upon its mission of conquest, and,
at the close of the second day, reached Xalapa, a mountain
town, and from which they looked back upon one
of the grandest views which they had ever seen.
Around were towering mountains; below lay the flat
region, a gay confusion of meadows, streams, and
flowering forests, with now and again a tiny Indian
village dotting the brilliant landscape. Far, far away,
to the eastward, was a faint line of light upon the
horizon, which told them that there rolled the ocean
which they had lately crossed, and beyond which slumbered
their country, which many never expected to see
again. To the south a mighty mountain, called “Orizaba,”
poked its head into the air, covered with a mantle
of snow; while toward the southwest the Sierra
Madre, with a dark belt of pine trees waving in the
breeze, stretched with a long line of shadowy hills into
the distance.</p>

<p>Onward and upward crawled the little army, pushing
and jerking the guns over the rocks and crevices,
and finally, on the fourth day, arrived at the town of
Naulinco. The Indian inhabitants entertained the soldiers
with great hospitality, for they were friendly with
the Totonacs.</p>

<p>Cortés endeavored to persuade them to give up their
savage idol worship, and, through a priest, Father
Almedo, had them instructed in the teachings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Christianity and had a cross erected for future worship.</p>

<p>The troops pressed onward, entered a narrow, ragged
valley, called “the Bishop’s Pass,” and, as they toiled
around a bare, volcanic mountain, a snow-storm descended
upon them with great violence. The Indians,
who were natives of the flat region, suffered dreadfully,
and several of them died by the way. The Spaniards,
however, were protected by their thick coats of cotton,
and thus bore up well beneath the change of climate.</p>

<p>For three days the little band pressed forward over
the rugged mountain trail,&mdash;then emerged into an open
country with a more genial climate. They had reached
the great table-land which spreads out for hundreds of
miles along the crests of the mountains, more than
seven thousand feet above the level of the sea. Carefully
cultivated fields of corn lay around them, and, as
they trudged forward, they came upon a populous city
made of substantial buildings of stone and of lime.</p>

<p>The army rested here for four or five days and then
went on through a broad valley shaded by lofty trees
and watered by a splendid river. An unbroken line of
Indian dwellings extended for several leagues, and, on
a knoll, stood a town of four to five thousand inhabitants,
commanded by a fortress with walls and trenches.
The army halted here and the troops were met with
friendly treatment.</p>

<p>As the soldiers refreshed themselves, Cortés made inquiries
concerning the route which he was to follow.
The Indians, who were traveling with him, told him to
go through Tlascala: a small republic which had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
managed to maintain its independence against Mexican
arms. The tribesmen had been friendly with the Totonac
allies of the Spaniards, and had the reputation of
being frank, fearless, and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Cortés decided to attempt to gain their good will, so
he dispatched four or five of his principal Cempoallan
allies to the Tlascalan capital with a cap of crimson
cloth and a sword and cross-bow, as gifts. They were
to ask permission to pass through the land and were to
express admiration for the valor and the courage of the
Tlascalans in resisting the Aztecs for such a long time.
Three days after the departure of these envoys, the
army resumed its march.</p>

<p>At last they reached the border of the Tlascalan territory,
and were much surprised to find a strong fortification
in their path. This was a stone wall nine feet
high and twenty feet thick, with a parapet a foot and
a half broad at the top, for the protection of those who
defended the causeway. It had only one opening in the
center, made by two semi-circular lines of wall which
overlapped each other. As it extended for more than
two miles and was built of natural blocks of stone, it
could be easily seen, that, had the Tlascalans cared to
dispute the passage of the Spanish invaders, not only
would they have inflicted great damage upon them, but
would undoubtedly have forced them to retire towards
the sea-coast.</p>

<p>Fortune favored the Spanish command. No Tlascalans
were there to hurl javelins and arrows into their
ranks, so they pressed onward towards the capital.</p>

<p>“Tlascala” means the land of bread. The Tlascalans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
were an agricultural people and their country
was very fertile. They had previously lived upon the
western shore of Lake Tezcuco, a part of Mexico which
was not very productive; but their neighbors had driven
them from their original holdings and were now very
jealous of their prosperity: so jealous, in fact, that the
Tlascalans repeatedly had to defend themselves against
their attacks. Montezuma, himself, had endeavored to
conquer them, but they had defeated an army sent
against them and commanded by the Emperor’s favorite
son. This had highly enraged the great ruler and he
repeatedly harassed them with his troops, so that they
were certainly glad to see some one journey to their land
with whom they could ally themselves. They had
heard about the Spaniards and their victorious advance,
but they had not expected that they would venture their
way. They were therefore much embarrassed when
they saw the white-skinned strangers at their very gates,
and demanding a passage through the fertile agricultural
regions which they had so often defended with
their lives.</p>

<p>While the Tlascalan chiefs were in the council chamber,
trying to make up their minds what to do, Cortés
and his men were advancing through their country. As
they threaded their way through a steep gorge, they
saw before them a small party of Indians armed with
swords and bucklers. They fled as the Spaniards approached,
but the men from Castile spurred their
horses, and overtook them. As they were endeavoring
to parley with them, the Indians turned and furiously
assaulted those in armor. A stiff fight ensued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and the native force would soon have been cut to pieces
had not a body of several thousand Indians appeared,
who rushed to their rescue. Cortés hastily dispatched
a messenger to bring up his infantry and stood off the
overwhelming masses of the enemy as best he could.
The Indians fought like tigers, dragged to the ground
one cavalier, who afterwards died of his wounds, and
killed two horses by cutting through their necks with
great broadswords. This was a serious loss to the
Spaniards, as their steeds were very few, and they
needed them, not only for battle, but also for hauling
their possessions over the rough mountain trails.</p>

<p>Arrows were whizzing fast around the ears of the
horsemen in the advance, when the infantry approached.
Hastily falling into position, the soldiers delivered a
volley from their crossbows, which not only astonished
the enemy, but threw them into great confusion. The
natives soon beat a hasty retreat, and the road towards
the Tlascalan capital was left open to the adventurers.</p>

<p>This was not the only battle with the Tlascalans.
Several other bands of natives were defeated as the
Spanish pressed forward, so that, when the daring
Cortés sent an embassy to the Tlascalan capital, his
men received a most respectful hearing from the dejected
natives, A free passage through the Tlascalan
possessions was offered to these white gods and they
were furnished with food.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of Montezuma?</p>

<p>As the terrible strangers advanced towards his capital,
news of all of their doings had been faithfully reported
to him by his runners, or messengers. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
learned, with dismay, that these fair-skinned soldiers
were defeating all of the natives that were sent against
them. He saw that they were practically invincible,
and that, before very long, they would be knocking at
the very gates of his capital. With great satisfaction
he had heard of their taking the road through the land
of the Tlascalans, for he knew these Indians to be
fiercely warlike, and he hoped that the white gods (so
called) were only mortal men, and would prove to be
no match for the natives who had defeated his own best
troops. Alas! He now learned that even these gallant
warriors had succumbed to the prowess of the
strangers.</p>

<p>In his alarm and uncertainty, he dispatched five
great nobles of his court, attended by two hundred
slaves, to bear to Cortés a gift consisting of three
thousand ounces of gold and several hundred robes of
cotton and of feather-work.</p>

<p>The Spanish leader received the fawning natives with
respectful attention. They laid the gifts at his feet
and told him that they had come to offer him Montezuma’s
congratulations upon his many victories. They
also stated that they wished to express their regret
that the Emperor could not receive them at the capital,
for his own population was so unruly, that, should they
enter the city, he could not answer for their safety. He
therefore respectfully requested Cortés to retire to the
sea-coast.</p>

<p>“I wish to express my greatest respect for Montezuma,”
replied the artful Cortés, “and I wish that I
could do as he desires. But I have received commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
from my own sovereign to visit the City of Mexico, and
it would go ill with me should I disobey the desires of
the mighty Monarch of Spain. Tell the great and
powerful Montezuma that I will some day repay him
for his wonderful presents. And tell him, also, that I
will be soon at the gates of Mexico City, where I hope
to be received in a style befitting the Monarch whom I
represent.”</p>

<p>The Mexican ambassadors withdrew, but they were
sadly displeased with the turn which matters were
taking. They saw a firm friendship established between
the Tlascalans&mdash;their mortal enemies&mdash;and
the dreaded Spaniards. They also saw that nothing
could deter the white men from coming forward. So,
with gloomy faces and lowered eyes, they departed for
the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>The Spanish troops were well treated by the Tlascalans,
who feasted and entertained them in the four
quarters of their city. But amid all these friendly
demonstrations the General never relaxed, for a second,
the discipline of the camp, and no soldier was allowed
to leave his quarters without special permission.</p>

<p>Montezuma, meanwhile, had received the message
from the doughty Spanish invader and was more frightened
than even before. Had he exhibited a good fighting
spirit, and had he been determined to expel the
Spaniards, he could have raised a hundred thousand
fighting men to overwhelm them as they advanced upon
his capital. But he was lacking in resolution. Deep
in his soul he had a suspicion that Cortes was really
the god Quetzalcoatl, come back again to Mexico in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
order to bring peace and prosperity with him. In his
heart he feared, that, should he kill the invader, he
would be sacrificing one of the gods. And thus he
vacillated, hesitated, and, at length, seeing that he
could not buy off the invader with money, or frighten
him by means of threats, determined to conciliate him.
So he sent word that he invited the Spaniards to visit
him in his capital, and requested them to take a route
through the friendly city of Cholula, where arrangements
were being made, by his orders, for their reception.
He also besought Cortés to make no alliance
with the Tlascalans; whom he called base, treacherous,
and barbarous.</p>

<p>But now came startling events, yet events which
pleased the daring Cortés greatly, for the conqueror
was never so happy as when in the thick of fighting.</p>

<p>After a short consultation among the officers, the
Spanish army moved forward on the road to Cholula.
It was an ancient and populous place, six leagues to the
south of Tlascala. Its inhabitants excelled in the art
of working in metals, and in manufacturing cotton
cloth and delicate pottery. They were not as bloodthirsty
as the surrounding tribes, but were distinguished
more for the skill in the arts than for their
warlike attainments. Here it is supposed that the god
Quetzalcoatl had paused on his way to the coast, many
years before, and to his honor a great pyramid had
been erected, upon which was a gorgeous temple and
a statue of the fair-skinned god, bedecked with gold
and with jewels.</p>

<p>Six thousand Tlascalan warriors allied themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with Cortés in his march towards the capital. As the
troops drew near the town of Cholula they were met by
swarms of men, women, and children, all eager to catch
a glimpse of these wonderful strangers. An immense
number of priests, swinging censers, mingled with the
crowd, and, as the Spaniards moved onward, they were
decorated with garlands of flowers; while musicians
filled the air with strange, melodious symphonies.
The strangers were given lodgings in the court of one
of the many <i>teocallis</i> and were well supplied with provisions.</p>

<p>All seemed to be going well, and the Spaniards were
highly pleased with their reception, but soon the scene
changed. Messengers arrived from Montezuma, who
told Cortés that his approach occasioned much disquietude
to their royal master. They hinted that he
would not be well received, and then had a separate conference
with the Cholulans. When they departed they
took one of them off with them. The Cholulans now
kept away from the Spanish camp, and, when pressed
for an explanation, made many excuses, saying that
they were ill. The supply of provisions ran short,
and, when asked to bring more corn, the Indians answered
that they were unable to do so, as it was very
scarce.</p>

<p>The doughty General of the Spanish forces became
alarmed at this sudden change. His allies, the Cempoallans,
now told him, that, in wandering about the
city, they had seen several streets barricaded, and, in
some places, they saw where holes had been dug and a
sharp stake planted upright in each. Branches had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
been strewn over these pits in order to conceal them.
They also announced that the flat roofs of the houses
were being stored with stones and with other missiles.</p>

<p>Cortés prepared for an attack, particularly as his
Tlascalan allies announced, that, in a far distant quarter
of the town, a number of children had been sacrificed
to the war god: the mighty Huitzilopochtli. They
reported, too, that numbers of the people had taken
their wives and children out of the city, as if to get
away from the battle which was imminent.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Marina made a discovery which
proved that the Spaniards were in a most precarious
position. The wife of one of the Cholulan caciques
had taken a great fancy to the Mexican girl, and had
continually urged her to visit her house; hinting, rather
carefully and very mysteriously, that she would, in this
way, escape a great danger which threatened the Spaniards.
Marina appeared to be delighted with this proposal,
and pretended to be glad to have a chance of
escaping from the white men. She, at length, won the
confidence of the Cholulan lady, who revealed the entire
plot to her, a plot which had originated with Montezuma,
and by which he hoped to get rid of these terrible
strangers.</p>

<p>A force of twenty thousand Mexicans, said the wife
of the cacique, were already near the city, and were to
fall upon the Spaniards and their allies as they left.
They were to be assisted by the Cholulans, who had
stored great quantities of rocks and arrows to hurl
upon the unsuspecting white men as they defiled along
the roadway leading to the City of Mexico. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
fair-faced strangers had been captured, some were to
be left with the Cholulans for sacrificial victims to their
gods; the rest were to be sent in chains to Montezuma.</p>

<p>Marina rushed to the gallant Cortés with the news of
this impending disaster to his army. The General at
once ordered the cacique’s wife to be seized, and she
repeated to him the same story that she had told to
Marina. The Spanish leader was not slow to act.
Two native priests were immediately summoned into
his presence, one of whom was a person of much prominence.
By courteous treatment and many presents, he
secured from them a complete confirmation of the story
which Marina had told him. There was no time to be
lost and Cortés was a man of action.</p>

<p>Sending for the more prominent Cholulans, Cortés
asked them to supply him with two thousand porters,
next morning, as he had determined to move his army
away from the town, and would need this many additional
men, in order to transport his luggage and the
many presents which had been given to him. After
some consultation, the chiefs decided to give him this
number of men, as it would assist them in their own
plan of annihilating the invaders of their country. But
Cortés had made up his mind how to act, and intended
to annihilate the Cholulans when once he had them in
his power. Night fell upon the city and every Spanish
soldier lay down fully armed. The sentinels were
doubled, but all remained quiet.</p>

<p>When the first streak of dawn reddened the east,
next morning, Cortés was ahorse, and was directing the
movements of his little band of heroic Spaniards. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
placed the greater portion of his small force in the
large oblong court in the center of the town. These
were lined up in a hollow square, facing the center, all
fully armed, with pouches filled with bullets, and quite
ready for anything that might occur. A strong guard
was placed at each of the three gates leading from the
town, and a number of the best soldiers were stationed
in charge of the cannon, which were pointed so as to
command all the more prominent roads leading to the
center of the native stronghold.</p>

<p>Hardly had this disposition of the troops been made
than the Cholulan caciques arrived, bringing a much
larger body of porters than Cortés had demanded.
They were placed within the hollow square formed by
the Castilian infantry.</p>

<p>The Spanish leader now took the caciques aside and
said in a stern tone:</p>

<p>“Know, O Chiefs, that I have learned of your conspiracy
to destroy me and my followers. I am fully
aware that you intend to fall upon me and my men
when we leave town, and I am determined to deal a
just and summary vengeance upon you.”</p>

<p>The Cholulans were thunderstruck, and gazed with
awe upon these strangers, who seemed to have the power
of reading their inmost thoughts. They made no attempt
to deny the accusation, but tried to excuse themselves
by throwing the blame upon Montezuma.</p>

<p>“The great Emperor made us do it,” said they.</p>

<p>“I do not care whether he made you do it or not,”
answered the irritated leader of these Spanish conquerors.
“For daring to think that you could capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and defeat me and my men, I will put you all to death,
so that it will teach any others who may have designs
upon my person, in the future, to leave me alone.
‘Fire!’”</p>

<p>As he spoke a cannon growled out an ominous roar.
It was the signal for which the Spanish soldiers had
been anxiously awaiting.</p>

<p>In an instant the muskets and crossbows were leveled
at the startled Cholulans, as they stood crowded together
in the center of the market place. A crash of firearms,&mdash;and
many of them lay groaning upon the pavement.
Then, with a fierce and vindictive yell, the
Spanish soldiers rushed at the natives with their swords,
and mowed them down as they stood. The Indians
had heard nothing of what was going on, and offered
but slight resistance to the armored men of Castile.</p>

<p>Wild shrieks and yells arose above the din of firearms,
as the massacre took place, and, attracted by the
noise, the Cholulans from outside began a furious
assault upon the Spanish soldiers. The heavy cannon
opened fire upon them as they approached, and, when
they advanced in close formation, many were swept off
their feet. The cavalrymen now charged into their
midst and hewed a passageway of blood in the lane of
human beings. The Tlascalan allies of the Spaniards
fell upon the rear of the battling Cholulans. Thus,
harassed upon every side, the Cholulan townsfolk could
no longer maintain their ground. They fled, some to
the buildings nearby, others to the temples of the gods.</p>

<p>Headed by several priests, one strong body of fugitives
ran to the largest of all the temples, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
<i>teocalli</i>. As the Spaniards came storming up the steps,
these rained down stones, javelins, and burning arrows
upon them. In spite of this shower of missiles, the
soldiers pressed hard upon the heels of the fugitives, set
fire to the wooden tower, and cheered wildly when they
saw the natives throw themselves headlong from the
parapet.</p>

<p>All was confusion and slaughter in the city of Cholula.
The Spaniards and Tlascalans plundered and
burned wherever they went, and, as the Tlascalans
seemed only to want clothes and provisions, the adventurers
under Cortés secured all the gold and jewels that
they cared to have. Thus fire, plunder, and murder
went on for many hours, until the General yielded to
the entreaties of the Cholulan chiefs, who had been
saved from the massacre, and, calling off his men, put
an end to further violence. By degrees the tumult was
appeased. The terrible vengeance of the invaders
made a great impression upon the natives, but no one
trembled more than did Montezuma on his throne
within the mountains.</p>

<p>The Mexican Emperor, in fact, felt his empire melting
away from him. His former vassals, on every
hand, were sending envoys to the Spanish camp to tender
their allegiance to the crown of Castile, and to attempt
to secure the favor of the conqueror by rich gifts
of gold and of slaves. Montezuma made up his mind
to send another embassy to Cortés, the members of
which were to impress upon him the fact that the Emperor
had nothing to do with the conspiracy at Cholula.
The envoys carried splendid presents of golden vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and ornaments, including artificial birds made in imitation
of turkeys with their plumage worked in gold,
and also fifteen hundred robes of delicate cotton cloth.
When they spoke to Cortés they told him that Montezuma
had no knowledge of the plot to attack the Spaniards
after they had left the town of Cholula and that
the Aztec force had been sent there, not to assist in annihilating
the Spaniards, but to quell a disturbance in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Cortés, who was not fooled by this series of lies by
Montezuma, remained quietly in the confines of
Cholula. He restored the city again to order, seized
upon the great temple, or <i>teocalli</i>, of which all the woodwork
had been burned, and built a church out of the
stones which remained. He also opened the cages in
which hundreds of captives were kept until the day
should come when they were to be sacrificed. After
this had been done, he called up the chiefs of his Tlascalan
allies, told them that the armies would now march
toward the City of Mexico, and, upon the day following,
set his own troops in motion.</p>

<p>He moved slowly, and soon was met by another embassy
from the Emperor, consisting of several Aztec
noblemen who brought a rich gift, indeed, and also a
message from the trembling Montezuma to the effect
that he would give four loads of gold to the General,
each year, and one load to each of his Captains, if he
would turn back from the city and would leave him
alone. Cortés was surprised at this show of weakness
and also pleased that the Aztec sovereign did not attack
him. He replied that he could not return to the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of Spain without first visiting the Emperor at his
capital.</p>

<p>“We Spaniards,” said he, “are advancing in a spirit
of peace, and wish to be courteously received. If, after
a short stay, you find our visit burdensome, it is very
easy for you to notify us that our presence in your
beautiful city is no longer desired.”</p>

<p>The ambassador reported this answer to Montezuma,
who called a council of his chief advisors to determine
what was now to be done. A great difference of opinion
arose. Cacama, the Emperor’s nephew, counseled
him to receive the Spaniards courteously, as the ambassadors
of a foreign prince; while his brother, Cuilahua,
urged him to muster all his fighting men and to
drive back the invaders, or die in the defense of his
capital.</p>

<p>Torn with doubt and distress, the Emperor did not
know which way to turn. It would not have been impossible
to strike the invaders with his warriors, but
Montezuma feared these white-skinned travelers as he
had never before feared any enemy.</p>

<p>“Of what avail is resistance,” said he, “when the
gods have declared themselves against us? I must
face the storm as best I may. I see my empire crumbling
to dust before these invaders, and I am prepared
to fight only when I see that I cannot rid myself of
them by peaceful means.”</p>

<p>Thus, trusting that he would eventually free himself
from this menacing band, Montezuma awaited the entry
of the Spaniards into the city.</p>

<p>The followers of Cortés, with their Tlascalan allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
now marched along the southern shores of Lake Chalco,
through forests of strange-looking trees, such as they
had never seen before, and orchards growing with unknown
fruits. At length they came to a great
dike, or causeway, four or five miles in length, which
divided Lake Chalco, from Xochicalco, on the west.
It was sufficiently wide, in some parts, for eight horsemen
to ride abreast; and was solidly built of stone and
of lime. At its narrowest part it was only a lance’s
length in breadth.</p>

<p>From the causeway the army descended upon a narrow
point which lay between the two lakes, and, quickly
crossing over this, reached the royal residence at Iztapalapan,
a place governed by Montezuma’s brother.
Here Cortés was presented with gifts of gold and costly
stuffs, and then the Spaniards were led into the gorgeous
halls of the palace, the roof of which was of
odorous cedar wood, while the stone walls were hung
with brilliant tapestries. Here, also, the army rested
for an entire night, ready and prepared for the advance
upon the following morning into the sacred precincts
ruled over by Montezuma.</p>

<p>Day dawned. As the sharp tones of the bugle woke
the echoes in the quaint Aztec village, the Spanish adventurers
bestirred themselves, formed in line of
march, and followed by the dark horde of Tlascalan
warriors, advanced upon the capital. Cortés’ force
was not more than seven thousand in all, and of this
number less than four hundred were Spaniards. The
adventure seemed foolhardy indeed. How could four
hundred Spaniards hope to conquer an entire country?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>At the distance of half a mile from the capital the
invaders encountered a solid fortification, like a great
curtain of stone, which was built across the dike. It
was twelve feet high, and had a tower on each end; in
the center was a battlement-gateway through which the
troops passed. This was the fort of Xoloc, and here
the Spaniards were met by several hundred Aztec chiefs.
After the usual salutations, the march was resumed, and
the army reached a wooden drawbridge which crossed
an opening in the dike. As the soldiers left it, they
realized that they were in the power of Montezuma,
for, had he so wished, he could cut them off from communication
with the country, and hold them prisoners
in his capital.</p>

<p>But now the Emperor Montezuma, himself, approached.
A crowd of Indian nobles surrounded him,
and he was preceded by his officers of state, bearing
golden wands. Reclining upon the royal palanquin,
blazing with burnished gold, he was borne aloft by four
attendants, who were barefooted, and who walked with a
slow, measured pace, their eyes bent upon the ground.
Montezuma wore a square cloak of the finest cotton, on
his feet were sandals with soles of gold, and both cloak
and sandals were sprinkled with pearls and with precious
stones. On his head was a plume of royal green
feathers, the badge of his military rank. He was at
this time about forty years of age, was tall and thin,
and lighter in color than most of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The Emperor received Cortés with princely courtesy,
and appointed his brother to conduct the Spaniards to
their quarters. The adventurers followed their guide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and, with colors flying and with music playing, entered
the southern portion of the Aztec capital. As they
proceeded, they crossed many bridges which spanned
the canals, and at length halted in a wide, open space,
near the center of the city and close to the temple of
the war god. Here were a number of low, stone buildings,
once a palace belonging to the Emperor’s father,
but now to become the lodging of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>After a rapid survey the General assigned the troops to
their respective quarters. He planted his cannon so as
to command the approaches to the palace, stationed sentinels
along the walls, and ordered that no soldier should
leave his quarters under pain of death. When all these
precautions had been taken, he allowed his men to enjoy
the banquet prepared for them.</p>

<p>Not long after this, Montezuma came to visit the
fair-skinned strangers, and was received with great
courtesy by Cortés, who had the faithful Marina to
interpret for him. The Emperor made many inquiries
concerning the country of the Spaniards, and particularly
asked why Cortés and his men had visited Mexico.</p>

<p>“We have desired to see you,” answered the General,
“and to declare to you the true faith which we, as
Christians, believe. We think that your own worship
is most pernicious, and we do not approve of the many
human sacrifices which you are continually making to
your gods. We therefore pray that you give up the
worship of idols, adopt the faith of Jesus Christ, and
cease to tear out the hearts of poor human beings as a
sacrifice in your temples.”</p>

<p>The Emperor smiled at the reference to the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
customs of the Aztecs, and made many inquiries concerning
the rank of the cavaliers in their own country
and their positions in the army. He then commanded
a gift of cotton robes to be distributed among the Spaniards
and their Tlascalan allies, and returned to his
own palace. When he had departed, Cortés ordered a
general discharge of his artillery, so as to impress the
natives with his power. The noise of the guns and the
smoke filled the Aztecs with alarm and dismay, and put
them in great fear of these strangers from another
country.</p>

<p>Cortés had several other audiences with the Aztec
ruler, who seemed to wish to treat these adventurers
with kindness and consideration; but the Spanish general
was harassed by many doubts. He was in the heart
of a great capital, with dikes and drawbridges on every
side, which might be converted into serious obstacles
against him and his men, should the Aztecs determine
to crush the small Spanish army. At a nod from the
mighty Montezuma all communication with the rest of
the country would be cut off, and the whole population
would be immediately hurled upon him and his handful
of followers. Against such odds, of what avail would
be his armor, his muskets, and his cannon? Montezuma
had a thousand warriors to his one. His best
policy, therefore, seemed to be to keep up the superstitious
reverence in which he seemed to be held by
both the Emperor and his people, and to find out all that
he could about the city and its inhabitants. Then,
should the opportunity occur, he would seize the chief
power for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day the General asked the Emperor’s permission
to visit the principal public buildings and received
a willing assent. Putting himself at the head of his
cavalry, and, followed by nearly all of his foot soldiers,
he set out, under the guidance of several caciques, to
view more closely what he had only seen at a distance.
He was led to the great <i>teocalli</i> of the god of war, Huitzilopochtli,
which stood in an open court surrounded by a
wall of stone and lime, about eight feet high, and ornamented
by raised figures of serpents, so that it was
called the “wall of serpents.” It was pierced by huge
gateways, opening upon the four principal streets of
the city, and over each gate was an arsenal filled with
arms and other warlike gear.</p>

<p>The Spanish visitors climbed up the flights of steps
and reached the great paved space at the summit, where
was a huge, round stone upon which the victims were
stretched before their hearts were cut out to propitiate
the feelings of the great god. At the other end of the
platform stood two towers, each three stories in height,
in which were the images of the gods.</p>

<p>Montezuma came forward to receive Cortés and conducted
him into the first tower, at the end of which, in a
huge recess, stood a colossal stone image of Huitzilopochtli,
the god of war. In his right hand he held
a bow: in his left a bunch of golden arrows. The
second sanctuary was dedicated to Tezcatlepoco, who
was believed to have created the earth and to watch
over it. He was represented as a young man,
although his image was made of polished, black stone,
garnished with gold plates and with ornaments. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
shield, burnished like a mirror, was upon one arm; and
in this was supposed to be reflected the doings of the
world.</p>

<p>On descending again to the courtyard, the cavaliers
took a careful look at the other buildings in the inclosure,
and saw, to their horror, a great mound with a
timber framework upon its summit, along which were
strung hundreds of thousands of skulls: those of the
many victims which had been sacrificed. The rest of
the space was filled with schools, granaries and gardens.
Several fountains, spouting crystal streams of water,
played gracefully in the clear air. It was a combination
of barbarism and civilization which was quite characteristic
of the Mexican people.</p>

<p>Upon the day following, the Spaniards asked permission
to convert one of the halls in their palace into a
chapel where they could hold the services of their
church, and Montezuma readily granted their request.
While the work was in progress, a young cavalier discovered
what seemed to be a door which had only
recently been plastered over. There was a rumor that
Montezuma kept the treasures of his father in this
place, so, to satisfy their eager curiosity, the plaster
was knocked away. Sure enough, a doorway was
beyond the plaster, and, pushing this aside, a great hall
was disclosed, filled with all manner of rich and beautiful
stuffs. There were also much gold and silver in
bars, and many jewels of inestimable value. Some
thought that all the riches in the world were in that
room. Afraid to touch it, then, by command of the
General, the wall was again built up, and strict orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were given that the discovery must be kept a profound
secret.</p>

<p>Time was passing and Cortés grew somewhat worried
over his position. Some of his officers were for an
immediate retreat. Some, and these were in the majority,
were well satisfied with the plan which their
General now disclosed to them, which was: to march to
the royal palace, and by persuasion, or force, to induce
Montezuma to take up his abode in the Spanish
quarters. When they had taken possession of his person,
it would be easy to rule in his name, until they
had made their position secure. Then, too, reënforcements
might reach them at any time.</p>

<p>An excuse soon offered itself, for two of the Spaniards
were treacherously murdered by the Aztecs, when upon
a journey to Vera Cruz, and this was sufficient pretext
to seize the person of the Emperor. Having asked for
an audience with Montezuma, which was granted, the
Spanish adventurer immediately made the necessary
arrangements for this hazardous enterprise. The
principal part of his force was drawn up in the courtyard,
next day, but one detachment was stationed in
the avenue leading to the palace, so that no rescue could
be attempted by the citizens. Twenty-five or thirty
soldiers were ordered to drop into the palace by twos
and by threes, as if accidentally, and Cortés was accompanied
by five cavaliers upon whose courage and coolness
he could perfectly rely. All were in full mail
and were armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>Montezuma seemed to be in great good spirits when
the Spaniards arrived, and paid Cortés the compliment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of offering him one of his daughters in marriage; an
honor which the general most respectfully declined, because
of the fact that he already had one wife. Not
long after this he saw that all of his soldiers were ready,
and, turning to Montezuma, asked him why the Aztecs
had murdered his two soldiers at Vera Cruz. The
Emperor listened to him with great surprise, and said
that such an act had never been by his direction.</p>

<p>“I care not whether you ordered this massacre or
not,” replied Cortés, “this native chief, Quanhpopoca,
whose men killed my soldiers, must be sent for at once,
so that I may deal with him as he deserves.”</p>

<p>Montezuma agreed to this, and, taking his royal signet
ring from his finger, gave it to one of his nobles,
with orders to show it to the Aztec governor and require
his immediate presence in the capital. In case
he resisted, the bearer was to call in the aid of the
neighboring towns and their fighting men.</p>

<p>The messenger had soon disappeared, and Cortés assured
the smiling Montezuma that he was now perfectly
convinced of his innocence in the matter, but that it was
quite necessary that his own sovereign should be assured
of it. Nothing could therefore be better than that
Montezuma should transfer his residence to the palace
occupied by the Spaniards, as this would show a personal
regard for the Spanish monarch which would
free him from all suspicion.</p>

<p>To this proposal Montezuma listened with the
greatest amazement, and then exclaimed, with resentment
and offended dignity:</p>

<p>“When was it that a great prince like myself willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
left his own palace to become a prisoner in the
hands of strangers?”</p>

<p>“You will not go as a prisoner,” replied the artful
Cortés, “but will simply be changing your residence.”</p>

<p>“If I should consent to such a degradation,” cried
Montezuma, wrathfully, “my subjects never would.”</p>

<p>But Cortés was obdurate and insisted that the Aztec
should go, in spite of the fact that the Emperor offered
him one of his sons and two of his daughters as hostages,
so that he might be spared this disgrace. Thus
two hours passed by in a fruitless discussion.</p>

<p>Finally Velasquez de Leon, one of the cavaliers, who
was impatient at the long delay, cried out in loud
tones:</p>

<p>“Why do we waste words on this barbarian? Let us
seize him, and, if he resists, let us plunge our swords
into his body!”</p>

<p>The fierce tones of the man in armor, coupled with
his menacing gesture, alarmed Montezuma, who asked
Marina what the angry Spaniard had remarked. The
Mexican girl explained, as gently as she could, what
had been said, then besought him to accompany the
white men, who would surely treat him with respect
and kindness.</p>

<p>“If you refuse,” she whispered, “you will, perhaps,
be killed.”</p>

<p>As she said this, the Emperor shuddered, and, looking
around for some sympathetic glance, saw only
the stern faces and mail-clad forms of the Spaniards.
He felt that, should he refuse, he would be immediately
dispatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will go with you, Malinche,” said he, in a scarcely
audible voice. “Bring forward the royal litter!”</p>

<p>As the Aztec retinue marched dejectedly down the
avenue to the Spanish quarters, the people crowded
together, crying out that Montezuma had been carried
off by force.</p>

<p>“Disperse, subjects!” cried the Emperor. “I am
visiting my friends of my own accord.”</p>

<p>The crowd remained quiet, and, on reaching the
Spanish quarters, Montezuma sent out his nobles to the
mob with similar assurances, and bade them all return
to their homes.</p>

<p>The Spaniards received him with great respect and
allowed him to choose his own apartments, which were
speedily furnished with tapestry, feather-work, and all
other Indian luxuries. Yet it was only too clear to the
Aztecs themselves that their honored Emperor was a
prisoner, as by day and night the palace was guarded
by sixty sentinels, both in the front and in the rear,
while yet another body was stationed in the royal antechamber.</p>

<p>In a day or two, the native chief, Quanhpopoca, arrived
from the coast. He was asked by Cortés why he
had made an attack upon his soldiers, and, as he could
make no satisfactory reply, was immediately condemned
to be burned to death. Montezuma made no
objection to this, so a funeral pile was erected in the
courtyard before the palace, and upon this the chief and
his attendants were burned. Just before the execution
took place, Cortés entered the Emperor’s apartment,
followed by a soldier bearing fetters in his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The Spanish general accused Montezuma of having
been the instigator of this treacherous deed, and said
that a crime which merited death in a subject, must be
likewise atoned for by a king. With this, he ordered
the soldier to fasten the fetters upon Montezuma’s
ankles, and, after coolly waiting until this was done,
turned his back upon the outraged Aztec Emperor, and
quitted the room.</p>

<p>After the execution was over Cortés came in and
unclasped the irons with his own hands. Montezuma
thanked him as if he had received some great and
unmerited favor.</p>

<p>Not long after this the Spanish commander told
Montezuma that he could return to his own quarters.
But the Emperor declined to go back, for, realizing how
his conduct must be viewed by the great nobles of his
Empire, he decided that his life was safer with the
Spaniards than with them. Although he had thus resigned
himself, without a fight, to a life of captivity,
some of his kinsmen were determined to rescue their
Emperor from the clutches of these fair-skinned invaders.
His nephew, Cacama, lord of the Tezcuco,
was especially incensed at the method by which Montezuma
had been stolen, and tried to stir up the Aztecs
to make an attack upon the Spanish robbers. Actuated
by jealousy, the other nobles refused to join Cacama,
declaring themselves unwilling to do anything without
the Emperor’s sanction.</p>

<p>Cortés heard of this, and wished to march at once
upon Tezcuco, in order to stamp out the spark of rebellion,
but Montezuma persuaded him to get hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Cacama personally, and to make away with him.
Cacama was enticed into a villa overhanging the lake,
where he was overpowered, forced into a boat, and
speedily brought to Mexico City. Here he was fettered
and imprisoned. His kingdom was given to his
brother,&mdash;a mere boy,&mdash;to reign in his stead.</p>

<p>Now Cortés felt himself powerful enough to demand
that Montezuma and all his nobles should formally
swear allegiance to the King and Queen of Spain. He
accordingly requested the Emperor to call together his
principal caciques, and, when they were gathered together,
Montezuma addressed them as follows:</p>

<p>“You all know, O caciques, our ancient tradition,
how the Great Being who once ruled over the land, declared
that he would one day return and reign again.
That time has now arrived. The white men have
come from the land beyond the sea, sent by their master
to reclaim the obedience of his ancient subjects. I am
ready, for my part, to acknowledge his authority. You
have been faithful vassals of mine all through the years
that I have sat upon the throne of my father; I now expect
that you will show me a last act of obedience, by
acknowledging the great King beyond the waters to be
your lord also, and that you will pay him tribute as you
have hitherto done to me.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the tears fell fast down his cheeks, and
his nobles were deeply affected by the sight of his distress.
Many of these fierce fighting-men had come
from a great distance, and had no idea of what was
going on in the capital. Hence they were filled with
astonishment at seeing the voluntary submission of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
master to this mere handful of Spanish soldiers. They
had always reverenced him as their all powerful lord,
and, therefore, were willing to obey him and to swear
allegiance to the white men’s sovereign. Accordingly
the oaths were administered, with due solemnity, and a
full record of these proceedings was drawn up by the
royal notary to be sent to Spain.</p>

<p>The Spanish explorer had now gained the greatest
object of the expedition, but in the conversion of the
natives to Christianity he seemed to have made little
progress, and the horrible sacrifices, where human
hearts were torn from the breasts of captives, were
occurring every day. What could be done? With the
blatant disregard for the sentiments of the natives that
had always characterized his actions, Cortés determined
to hold the services of the church in the temple
of the great god, Huitzilopochtli, and notified Montezuma
to this effect. The Emperor listened in great
consternation.</p>

<p>“Malinche,” said he, “why will you push matters
to an extremity that will surely bring down the vengeance
of our gods and stir up an insurrection amongst
my people? They will never endure this profanation
of their temple. Do not attempt to destroy their gods,
for, if you do so, you will be driven from the land by
the enfuriated populace.”</p>

<p>In spite of what the weak-minded ruler had said,
Cortés decided to hold the services of the church in one
of the sanctuaries of the famous temple, which was
dedicated to the fearful god of war. Consequently, the
whole army moved, one day, in a solemn procession up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the winding ascent to the pyramid, and mass was celebrated
by Father Almedo. The Aztecs crowded around
in order to view this ceremony, and looked on with repugnance
plainly showing in their dark faces.</p>

<p>As Montezuma had prophesied, the Mexican people
were greatly outraged by this profanation of their
temple, and many conferences now took place between
the Emperor and the nobles. After several weeks,
Cortés received a summons to appear before the Aztec
chief, who said, in rather apologetic tones:</p>

<p>“What I told you in connection with the insult to
our gods has come to pass. The gods are offended and
they threaten to forsake our city if you and your men
are not driven from it. If you regard your safety,
you will leave the country without delay. I have only
to lift my finger and every Aztec in the land will rise
against you.”</p>

<p>“I shall greatly regret to say good-bye to your capital,”
Cortés answered. “I cannot leave your country,
for I have no ships in which to sail. Besides, if I am
driven out, I shall have to take you with me.”</p>

<p>Montezuma, although troubled with this last suggestion,
offered to send workmen to the coast to assist the
Spaniards in building ships. In the interim he assured
the populace that the white men would leave
in a very few weeks. Cortés, meanwhile, sent word to
delay the construction of ships as long as possible, for
he hoped, in the meantime, to receive reënforcements
from Spain, so that he could hold his ground. The
Spaniards were now thoroughly frightened, for they
were surrounded by hundreds of thousands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
enemy, and, should these break loose upon them, they
knew that they should have to fight for their lives.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs, in May, 1520, after the
Spaniards had been six months in the country of Mexico.
Then came an unexpected thunderclap, for Cortés
received word from the coast that the jealous Governor
of Cuba, hearing of his great success, was forwarding
an expedition to attack him. Think of it! To attack
the one who had accomplished that which he had been
sent to accomplish!</p>

<p>The commander of this second expedition, Narváez,
sent several of his most trusted adherents to
Villa Rica, where Cortés had left a body of men under
one Sandoval, to demand his capitulation. But, Sandoval
would hear nothing of this, and, binding the
emissaries to the backs of several sturdy porters, like
bales of cotton, he sent them, under guard, to Mexico
City, where Cortés received them courteously. He
learned that the principal object of Narváez was the
finding of gold, and that the soldiers of this interloper
had no particular regard for their leader, as he was
arrogant and by no means liberal.</p>

<p>The General decided that the only thing to do was
to march against this man, to defeat him, and to unite
the new forces with his own. This he did. The newcomer
was captured, his troops willingly joined with
the followers of Cortés, and the bold Spaniard returned
to Mexico City, where he had left his Lieutenant Alvarado
in command. But he found that matters had
gone very ill since his departure, and that insurrection
and bloodshed were rampant in the once quiet capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The General eagerly inquired what had transpired
during his absence, and found that Alvarado had acted
in a manner that was not only undiplomatic but also
bloodthirsty. A few days after Cortés had marched
towards the coast, the Aztec festival of “The Incensing
of Huitzilopochtli” was celebrated, and, having asked
permission to use the <i>teocalli</i>, the Aztecs assembled to
the number of at least six hundred. The natives wore
their magnificent gala attire, with mantles of feather-work
sprinkled with precious stones, and collars, bracelets,
and ornaments of gold. Alvarado and his men,
fully armed, attended as spectators, and, as the natives
were engaged in one of their ceremonial dances, fell
upon them suddenly,&mdash;sword in hand. A great and
dreadful slaughter now followed, the Aztecs being
hewn down without resistance. Those who attempted
to escape by climbing the wall of serpents, were cut
down to a man, until not a single one remained alive.
The tidings of this awful massacre flew instantly
through the capital, and the city rose in arms against
these terrible invaders, who would do such a dastardly
deed.</p>

<p>The Spaniards made themselves secure in their citadel,
but they were attacked with the greatest fury.
The works were undermined, and some of the more
courageous assailants set fire to the walls. Montezuma
was entreated to interfere, and, mounting the battlement,
requested the howling mob of Aztecs to desist
from storming the fortress, out of regard for his own
safety. This they did, although a regular blockade
was begun, and high walls were thrown up around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
citadel in order to prevent the egress of the Spaniards.
The Aztec warriors chanted defiance at Alvarado and
his men, while sullenly awaiting the time when the
Spaniards would be starved into submission.</p>

<p>Cortés was angered and ashamed at the action which
his Lieutenant had taken, and, calling him to him,
roundly upbraided him for attacking the natives in this
brutal fashion. As an explanation for his atrocious
act, Alvarado declared that he had struck this blow in
order to intimidate the natives and crush an uprising
which he had learned was about to occur.</p>

<p>“You have done badly!” cried Cortés. “You have
been false to your trust and your conduct has been that
of a madman!”</p>

<p>The Spanish commander lost his self-control for the
first time, and allowed his disgust and irritation to be
plainly seen. He bitterly regretted that he had entrusted
so important a command to one who had such a
rash and cruel nature. But the deed was done. The
Aztecs were now in open revolt, and the Spaniards had
to battle for their very lives. The whole city was in
arms, the drawbridges were raised, and the enemy was
collecting from every quarter.</p>

<p>As Cortés directed the troops within the citadel, to
which he had had to fight his way after the destruction
of Narváez, he heard a long, hoarse, sullen roar
from the streets of the city. It became louder and
louder, until, as he stood upon the parapet and looked
into the distance, he could see dark masses of warriors
rolling towards the citadel in a confused tide, while the
flat roofs of the houses nearby were covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
swarms of menacing figures, who brandished their
weapons, and cried out with shrill voices: “Death to
the invaders! Death to the enemies of our gods!
Death to the dogs from Spain!” The great war drum
upon the <i>teocalli</i> rolled out a mournful and doleful
sound of battle, while gay banners fluttered from the
serried ranks of the approaching army.</p>

<p>On, on, came the wild Aztecs, their shrill yells sounding
high above the rolling of their rude drums, and, as
they came within sight of the Spanish quarters, they
let loose a perfect tempest of stones, darts, and arrows.
At the same time those upon the roofs let drive a blinding
volley. The men under Cortés waited until the
enemy were within a hundred yards of the ancient
palace, in which they had barricaded themselves, and
then thundered a return volley from their cannon and
guns. The first few ranks of the Aztec warriors were
swept to the ground, but, leaping over the prostrate
bodies of the slain, the great horde of fighting men
came on. Soon some of the bolder warriors succeeded
in getting close enough to the wall to be sheltered by it
from the fire of the Spaniards, so they made a gallant
yet futile effort to scale the parapet. As soon as their
heads appeared above the ramparts, they were shot
down, one after another, and fell to the street below.
Great piles of the slain lay heaped before the ancient
palace of the Montezumas.</p>

<p>Burning arrows were now shot upon the buildings in
the courtyard, and several of them took fire. So severe
was the conflagration that a part of the wall had to be
thrown down, thus laying open a formidable breach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which the Aztecs endeavored to storm. But cannon
were pointed at the spot, and a file of arquebusiers
kept up an incessant volley-fire through the opening, so
that those who attempted to get through were killed as
fast as they reached the portal. All day long the fight
raged with fury, and, when night came, the Spaniards
could get no sleep, for they were in hourly expectation
of a new attack.</p>

<p>Next morning the mournful war-drum again groaned
out its call to the battle, and again the serried
ranks of the enfuriated Aztec warriors came on to the
attack. Showers of burning arrows, darts, and heavy
stones fell against the Spanish battlement, and the
mass of warriors struggled with renewed fury to gain
possession of the breach. Cortés ordered a sortie, hoping
to drive this body of invaders away, but, when the
gates were thrown open and he dashed forward with
the cavalry, assisted by a large force of Tlascalans, the
natives retreated behind a barricade. Heavy guns
were ordered up, and the barriers were demolished;
but, as he pressed the Aztecs backwards, so many came
in upon the flanks that he was forced to retreat. As
the Spaniards reëntered their fortress, pursued by
a shower of darts and arrows, the Indians once
more closed around it, with menacing cries and insults.</p>

<p>“The gods have delivered you into our hands at
last!” they called. “Huitzilopochtli has long been
crying for his victims, and the stone of sacrifice is ever
ready. Our knives are sharpened. The wild beasts
in the palace are roaring for their feast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet they cried piteously for Montezuma and entreated
the Spaniards to deliver him up to them.</p>

<p>“Oh, give us back our Emperor!” said they.
“You have willfully and falsely detained and imprisoned
him!”</p>

<p>At this, Cortés determined to induce Montezuma to
exert his authority, in order to allay the tumult. So
he requested the captive Emperor to speak to the howling
mob. Montezuma had soon arrayed himself in his
finest robes, and with a guard of Spaniards around him,
and preceded by an Aztec carrying a golden wand (the
symbol of sovereignty) the Indian monarch ascended
the central turret of the palace.</p>

<p>A marvelous and magical change now came over the
scene. The fierce and vindictive war cries of the Aztec
warriors ceased. Great rows of Indians prostrated
themselves on the ground, while all eyes were turned
upon the monarch whom they had been taught to venerate
with slavish awe. The Spaniards were startled
at the homage which was given to the cowardly Emperor,
and Montezuma, himself, saw his advantage.
He felt himself once again a king, and addressed the
multitude with all of his former authority and confidence.</p>

<p>“Why do I see my people here in arms against the
palace of my father?” said he. “Is it that you think
your sovereign a prisoner and wish to release him?
If so, you have done well; but you are mistaken. I am
no prisoner. These strangers are my guests. I remain
with them only by choice and I can leave them
when I will. Have you come to drive them from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
city? That is unnecessary; they will depart of their
own accord, if you will open a way for them. Return
to your homes! Lay down your arms! Show your obedience
to me, whose right it is. The white men shall
go back to their land, and all shall be well again within
the walls of Mexico.”</p>

<p>A murmur of contempt ran through the multitude.
Rage and desire for revenge made the Aztec warriors
forget their reverence for their former beloved Emperor,
and they now turned against the very man
whose word had once been their law.</p>

<p>“Base Aztec!” they cried out in loud tones. “You
are a woman and a coward! The white men have made
you a female, fit only to weave and to spin! Begone!
Back to your needlework and to your Spanish
brothers!”</p>

<p>Immediately the Emperor was assailed by a cloud of
rocks and arrows. A stone struck the miserable man
in the head, with a sickening thud, and knocked him to
the ground. A chief of high rank hurled his javelin
at him, but it just missed him as he fell. The Mexicans
were shocked at their own act of sacrilege and set
up a dismal cry. They dispersed, panic-stricken, and
not one remained in the great square before the
palace.</p>

<p>With care and gentleness the Spaniards carried the
body of Montezuma to his own apartments. As soon as
he recovered from his insensibility, the full misery of
his situation broke upon him. He, the once great and
powerful Montezuma, had been reviled and rejected by
his own people. Utterly crushed in spirit, he refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
all food or assistance, even tearing off the bandages
which the Spaniards applied to his wounds. He sat
motionless, with eyes cast upon the ground, perpetually
brooding over his humiliation, and gradually grew so
weak that he could scarcely sit upright.</p>

<p>A body of Mexicans now took possession of the famous
temple to the war god, Huitzilopochtli, which was
opposite the Spanish palace, and rose to a height of
nearly a hundred and fifty feet. From this vantage
point the Aztecs discharged such a volley of arrows
upon the garrison, that it was impossible for any soldier
to show himself for an instant outside the wall of the
palace, without being immediately struck. The Mexicans,
meanwhile, were completely sheltered. As it was
absolutely necessary that they be driven from this point
of vantage, Cortés intrusted the task to his chamberlain,
Escobar, giving him a hundred men for the purpose.
Three desperate attempts were made, but being
repulsed with considerable loss, this officer returned,
and Cortés determined to lead the storming party himself.
A wound in his left hand had almost disabled it,
but he strapped his shield to the injured member and
thus sallied forth.</p>

<p>Several thousand of the Tlascalan allies were with
him, and, at the head of three hundred chosen cavaliers,
he now dashed from the palace. In the courtyard
of the temple, a body of Mexicans was drawn up to dispute
his passage, but he charged them briskly, and,
although the horses could not stand up and had to be
returned to the Spanish quarters, the Aztecs were dispersed.
The cavaliers and their Indian allies now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pressed up to the flight of stone steps which led into
the <i>teocalli</i>. The warriors were drawn up on every
terrace, as well as on the topmost platform, and
showered down heavy stones, beams, and burning rafters.
The Spaniards kept on, in spite of the fact that
many of them were badly wounded by the falling
beams and arrows, and, aided by a brisk fire from the
muskateers below, soon drove the Aztecs to the broad
summit of the <i>teocalli</i>. Here a desperate hand-to-hand
fight took place.</p>

<p>As the edge of the platform was unprotected by either
battlement or parapet, many of the combatants, as they
struggled together, rolled off, locked in a deadly deathgrip.
Two powerful Aztecs seized upon Cortés, at
one stage of the battle, and were dragging him violently
toward the side of the pyramid, when, by sheer
strength, he tore himself from their grasp and hurled
one of them over the edge.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fight for the possession of
this temple, the priests ran to and fro among the contestants,
with their long hair streaming out behind them.
With wild gestures they encouraged and urged on the
Indians, until they were all either killed or captured
by the onrushing Spanish cavaliers.</p>

<p>One by one the Indian warriors fell dead upon the
blood-drenched pavement, or were hurled from the
dizzy height to the pavement below, until, at last, none
were left to oppose the white men. The Spaniards,
with yells of victory, now rushed into the sanctuaries.
In one was the hideous image of Huitzilopochtli
with an offering of human hearts before him. Possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
these were those of their own countrymen! With
loud shouts of triumph the Spaniards tore the hideous
idol from its niche, and, as the Aztecs watched, hurled
it down the long steps of the <i>teocalli</i>. Then the sanctuaries
were set on fire, and, descending joyfully to the
courtyard, the soldiers set up a great song of thanksgiving
for their victory.</p>

<p>Cortés now hoped that the natives were sufficiently
subdued to be willing to come to terms with him, so
he invited them to a parley, and addressed the principal
chiefs. He talked to them from the turret previously
occupied by Montezuma, and, as usual, had Marina
to interpret for him.</p>

<p>“You have brought all this slaughter upon yourselves
by your rebellion,” he said. “Yet, for the sake
of the affection felt for you by the sovereign whom
you have treated so unworthily, I would willingly stay
my hand if you will lay down your arms and return
once more to obedience to me. If you do not do this,
I will make your city a heap of ruins, and will leave
not a single soul alive to mourn over it.”</p>

<p>The Aztecs replied in a manner which was quite
unexpected.</p>

<p>“It is quite true that you have destroyed our gods,
massacred our countrymen, and broken our temple to
pieces. But look out upon our streets and terraces.
You see them thronged with warriors as far as your eyes
can reach,” said the Indian who had been chosen
spokesman. “Our numbers are scarcely diminished
by our losses. Yours, on the contrary, are lessened
every hour. Your provisions and your water are failing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
you are perishing from hunger and from sickness;
you must soon fall into our hands. The bridges
are broken down and you cannot escape! There
will be few of you left to glut the vengeance of our
gods.”</p>

<p>With this tart reply, they discharged a volley of arrows,
which compelled the Spaniards to beat a speedy
retreat.</p>

<p>To retreat was hazardous, indeed, and it was mortifying
to abandon the city; but, with his men daily diminishing
in strength and in numbers, and with his
stock of provisions so nearly exhausted that one small
daily ration of bread was all that the soldiers had, there
was nothing else for Cortés to do. Montezuma had
lingered feebly along, after the day in which he had
been struck by a stone, and now passed to another world.
“The tidings of this,” says an old historian, “were received
with real grief by every cavalier and soldier in
the army who had access to his person, for we all loved
him as a father.” The Emperor’s death was a misfortune
for the Spaniards, because, while he lived,
there was a slight possibility of using his influence
with the natives. Now that hope had disappeared.</p>

<p>A council was called to decide as speedily as possible
the all-important question of the retreat. It was agreed
that they should leave at once, and at night, so that
darkness would cloak their movements. The safe conveyance
of the treasure was quite a problem, but the
soldiers had converted their share into gold chains, or
collars, which could be easily carried about their persons.
The royal fifth, however, was in bars and wedges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of solid gold. It could be carried only by horse, and a
special guard had to be provided for it. But much
treasure had to be abandoned, and it lay in shining
heaps upon the floor of the palace.</p>

<p>The soldiers who had come with Cortés, being old
campaigners, did not load themselves down with more
than they could safely transport. The soldiers of
Narváez, however, being keen for the accumulation of
treasure, loaded themselves down with all that they
could possibly carry off with them.</p>

<p>As the retreat was to be over the causeway and dykes,
a portable bridge was constructed which could be laid
across the open canals. This was entrusted to the care
of an officer named Magarino and forty men. Cortés
arranged the order of march. First was to go two hundred
Spanish foot soldiers, commanded by a Captain
Sandoval, with twenty other cavaliers. The rear guard
was formed of infantry under Alvarado and De Leon,
while the center was in charge of Cortés, himself, with
some heavy guns, the baggage and the treasure. There
were also the prisoners, among whom were a son and
two daughters of Montezuma, Cacama, and several
nobles. The Indian allies, the Tlascalans, were divided
up among the three divisions. There were several
thousand of these.</p>

<p>Midnight came and all was ready for the journey.
A solemn mass was celebrated by Father Almedo, and,
keeping as quiet as they possibly could, the Spaniards
sallied forth from the ancient palace of the Aztecs,
which had been the scene of so much suffering and
fighting. The night was a dark one, and a fine, misty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
rain fell steadily upon the serried columns of Spanish
cavaliers and brown-skinned natives.</p>

<p>The vast square before the palace was deserted.
Through some superstitious dread, the natives had not
frequented the plaza since the death of their Emperor,
Montezuma, and the Spaniards crossed it as noiselessly
as possible, entering the great street of Tlacopan.
They peered anxiously into the gloom, expecting to be
attacked at any moment by a swarm of Aztecs, but all
went well with them until the first files of soldiers drew
near the spot where the street opened upon the causeway,
which led by the side of the lake. Here there
were Mexican sentinels at their posts, and, as the bridge
was being adjusted across the uncovered breach, the
Aztecs fled, crying out in loud tones that the hated
white men were leaving the city.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a commotion. The priests
heard the shouting from the summits of their <i>teocalli</i>
and beat upon the peculiar shells which were used for
rousing the people. The huge drum upon the temple
of the god of war was struck and gave forth a hollow,
moaning roar which vibrated through every corner of
the capital. The Spaniards were alarmed and worked
with desperate fury to place their bridge across the
causeway so that the army could escape. But, as the
soldiers labored valorously, a sound was heard like a
stormy wind as it rises in a forest. Nearer and nearer
it came, and, from the dark waters of the lake came the
splashing of many paddles. A few stones and arrows
fell among the hurrying troops. More and more followed
in rapid succession until they became a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
blinding storm. Yells and shrill war-cries rent the air,
and, before the Spaniards well realized their position,
they found themselves surrounded by myriads of the
enemy, who were swarming over land and lake.</p>

<p>The Aztecs ran their canoes along the sides of the
causeway, climbed up, and charged the ranks of the
Spaniards, with their Tlascalan allies. The soldiers
shook them off as best they could, rode over them with
their horses, and, with their pikes and their swords,
drove them headlong down the sides of the dike. They
halted and waited for the bridge to be brought up;
but a terrible calamity had occurred, for the bridge
had been so borne down by the weight of the artillery
passing over it, that it had jammed firmly into the sides
of the dike and was immovable.</p>

<p>The tidings spread rapidly from man to man and a
cry of despair arose, for all means of advance were
cut off, and the Spaniards were caught in a trap. Those
behind pressed forward, trampling the weak and the
wounded under foot, and forcing those in front over the
gulf. Some of the cavaliers succeeded in swimming
their horses across, but many rolled back into the lake
when attempting to ascend the opposite bank. The infantry
followed in a panic, and many of the men were
pierced by the Aztec arrows, or struck down by war
clubs. Some were dragged into the canoes to be later
sacrificed to the great and awful stone god. Fierce
battle cries rose above the tumult of war, and these
were mingled with the cries of despair of the drowning
Spaniards.</p>

<p>By degrees the opening in the causeway was filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
up by the wreck of the wagons, guns, rich bales of stuffs,
chests of solid ingots, and bodies of men and horses.
Walking on top of this dismal ruin, those in the rear
were able to reach the other side.</p>

<p>As the attention of the Aztec warriors now fell upon
the rich spoil that strewed the ground, the pursuit of
the Spaniards ceased. The troops pressed forward
through the village of Popotla, where Cortés dismounted
from his weary war-horse, and, sitting down upon the
steps of an Indian temple, looked mournfully at his
broken army, as the thin and disordered ranks filed
past. It was a heartrending spectacle. He knew,
however, that this was no time to give away to vain regrets,
so he speedily mounted, and led his men through
Tlacopan.</p>

<p>The broken army, disorganized and half starved,
moved slowly toward the sea coast. On the seventh day
it reached the mountain range which overlooks the
plains of Otumba, and the scouts, climbing the steep
hillside, reported that a mighty host of warriors was
in the valley, ready to dispute their passage. Every
chief of importance had taken the field, and, as far as
the eye could reach, extended a moving mass of glittering
shields and spears, mingled with the banners and
the bright feather-mail of the caciques.</p>

<p>Cortés disposed his army to the best advantage, and
prepared to cut his way through the enemy. He gave
his force as broad a front as possible, protecting it on
either flank by his cavalry, now reduced to but twenty
horsemen. His directions to his infantrymen was that
they were to thrust, not strike, with their swords, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
were to make for the leaders of the enemy, whom they
were to dispatch as soon as met with. After a few
brave words of encouragement, the little band began to
descend the hill. The enemy set up fierce war cries,
as they approached, and met the Spaniards with a storm
of stones and arrows.</p>

<p>Now occurred a bitter fight. The Spaniards, at first,
beat through the crowd of natives, but, as the battle
progressed, they were surrounded on every side by a
swarm of warriors. Cortés received a wound in the
head and his horse was killed beneath him, so that he
was obliged to mount one taken from the baggage train.
His men became exhausted beneath the fiery rays of
the sun and began to give way. The enemy, on the
other hand, was constantly being reënforced from the
rear, and pressed on with redoubled fury.</p>

<p>Matters were critical for the Spaniards, when Cortés
did a deed of daring which was quite worthy of the
Chevalier Bayard, or Murat, the famous Napoleonic
leader of horse. With his keen eye he discovered in
the distance a chief, who, from his dress and surroundings,
he knew to be the leader of the Aztec forces.
Turning to his favorite henchmen, the brave Spaniard
cried out, while pointing his finger at the chief:</p>

<p>“There is our mark! Follow and support me!”</p>

<p>Then, shouting his war cry, he plunged into the
thickest of the press and bore towards the noble Aztec.</p>

<p>The enemy was taken completely by surprise and
fell back. Many could not dodge aside and were
trampled down by the war-horse, or pierced by the
long lance which Cortés wielded with all the skill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a trained fencer. The cavalier companions of the gallant
Spaniard followed him closely, and, in a few moments,
they had come within striking distance of the
Aztec chieftain. Cortés rode speedily at him, and,
thrusting with his lance, brought him to earth, where he
was stabbed to death by a young Spaniard called Juan
de Salamanca. Tearing his banner from his clinched
fist, the Castilian presented it to Cortés, who waved it
triumphantly above his head. The caciques’ guard,
surprised by this sudden onset, fled precipitously, while
the panic spread to the other Indians. The Spaniards
pursued them for several miles, then returned to
secure the rich booty which they had left behind them.
Truly the battle had been won by the daring and personal
initiative of the brave Spanish leader.</p>

<p>The adventurers were now safely out of their grave
peril. They reached Tlascala in a few days, and, with
the assistance of their native allies, at once prepared to
revenge themselves upon the Aztecs. Several Spaniards
were at Vera Cruz and these joined them. But
there was much need of gunpowder, and there was no
way of getting sulphur for its manufacture, unless it
was obtained from one of the many volcanoes in the
neighborhood. How was this to be done?</p>

<p>A cavalier, named Francio Montaño, was equal to
the emergency and suggested that he be allowed to descend
into the terrible volcano of Popocatepetl, where
sulphur, in a crude form, hung to the side of the crater.
Cortés was only too willing to allow him to make the
attempt, so accompanied by several others, he set out.
After great hardship, and, after passing through a region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of perpetual snow, the explorers reached the mouth
of the fierce volcano, and, crawling cautiously to the
very edge, they peered down into its gloomy depths.
At the bottom of the dark abyss a lurid flame was burning,
and, every now and again, arose a sulphurous
stream, which, cooling as it came upward, fell again in
showers upon the side of the cavity. It was necessary
to descend into this crater, with the boiling lava below,
in order to scrape some of the sulphur from the sides.</p>

<p>Montaño himself drew the longest stem of grass,
when the Spaniards had prepared lots to see who should
descend, and, clinging to a basket and rope, was soon
four hundred feet within the horrible chasm. As he
hung there, he scraped the sulphur from the sides of
the crater, descending again and again, until he had
procured enough for the wants of the army. Then,
with great elation, the adventurous sulphur hunters returned
to Tlascala, where their arrival was greeted with
shouts of joy.</p>

<p>Cortés was fully prepared to march again to the
Mexican capital and to wreak vengeance upon the
Aztecs, who were now governed by Guatemozin, a young
prince who had married one of Montezuma’s daughters.</p>

<p>The Spanish army consisted of about six hundred
men, of which forty were cavalry, and eighty were
arquebusiers and cross-bowmen. There were nine
cannon. The men were armed with swords and with
long copper-headed pikes, which had been specially constructed
under the direction of the General. There
were, also, the Tlascalan allies, who were still anxious
and willing to fight their hated enemies, the Aztecs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Numerous other bands of Indians also flocked to the
Spanish standard.</p>

<p>Cortés determined to march to Tezcuco, establish his
headquarters upon the side of the great lake which was
near the Mexican capital, and to begin a blockade of
the city of the Aztecs, until some ships, which he was
having constructed, could be brought to him. Then he
could transport his troops to the edge of the city and
begin a direct assault.</p>

<p>Everything went well with both ships and men. The
vessels reached the lake in good order, were launched,
and were filled with soldiers. The plan of action
against the city was to send the cavalier, Sandoval, with
one division, to take possession of Iztapalapan at the
southern end of the lake, while Alvarado and Olid were
to secure Tlacopan and Chapultepec upon the western
shore, destroy the aqueduct, and thus cut off the city’s
supply of fresh water. This was successfully done and
soon the Spaniards had penetrated into the city as far
as the great <i>teocalli</i>. The natives were driven before
them, while the Tlascalans in the rear filled up the
gaps and brought up the cannon.</p>

<p>As you remember, it was at the great <i>teocalli</i> that
the most serious fighting occurred when the Spaniards
were previously driven from the city. Now still fiercer
battling took place and the Spaniards again captured
this temple of the war-god. Some of them rushed to
the top and there found a fresh image to Huitzilopochtli.
Tearing off the gold and jewels with which it was bedecked,
they hurled it, with its attendant priests, over
the side, with a mighty yell of defiance. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hastened below to the assistance of their comrades, who
were being furiously assailed by the Aztecs.</p>

<p>Things were going ill with the Spaniards and they
were being driven down the great street of the city in
hopeless confusion and panic. Luck was with them,
however, for a small force of cavalry now arrived,
charged into the mass of yelping Indians, and drove
them back again to the <i>teocalli</i>. Here Cortés attacked
by the flank and the natives retired in confusion and
dismay. Evening was now coming on, so the Spanish
troops retreated in good order, their Tlascalan allies
pulling down many of the houses as they departed. The
palace of Montezuma was set afire, and this sight so
maddened the Aztecs, that they redoubled their efforts
to head off the disappearing white men. It was of
no avail. The attacking Spaniards soon reached Xoloc,
where they learned that many of the native tribes, seeing
the Mexicans unable to hold the city, would join
with the men from Castile.</p>

<p>After months of siege the Aztecs still defied the conquerors
and fiercely rejected all overtures of peace,
although the banner of Castile floated undisturbed from
the smoldering remains of the sanctuary on the <i>teocalli</i>
of the war-god. Hundreds of famishing wretches died
every day and lay where they fell, with no one to bury
them. In the midst of all this brutality and misery,
Guatemozin remained calm and courageous, and was
as firmly resolved as ever not to capitulate.</p>

<p>An assault was ordered, and, although the Mexicans
fought valiantly, they were weakened by starvation
and could not struggle as before. After a bloody battle,
the Spanish commander withdrew to his quarters,
leaving behind him forty thousand corpses and a smoldering
ruin. This blow seemed to utterly stun the Aztecs.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Cortés now determined to secure the person of
Guatemozin, so, upon the following day, August 13th.,
1521, the Spaniards again advanced into the town and
were soon battling fiercely with the Aztecs. While this
was going on several canoes pushed off across the lake.
The Spanish ships gave chase and sunk most of them,
but a few succeeded in getting into open water. Two
or three large canoes, close together, attracted the attention
of a soldier, named Garci Holguin, who instantly
gave chase, and, with a favorable wind, soon
overtook the fugitives, although they rowed with great
energy. The Spaniards leveled their guns at the Indians,
when one rose, saying:</p>

<p>“I am Guatemozin. Lead me to Malinche. I am
his prisoner. But let no harm come to my wife and
to my followers.”</p>

<p>The Emperor was taken on board one of the ships
and was ordered to call upon his people to surrender.</p>

<p>“There is no need of this,” he answered sadly, “for
they will fight no longer when they see that their Emperor
has been captured.”</p>

<p>He had spoken correctly, for, when the news of his
capture reached the shore, the Mexicans at once ceased
to defend themselves. They had put up a hard battle
in order to give their Sovereign an opportunity to
escape.</p>

<p>Cortés had been watching the affair from the flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
roof of one of the houses and now sent word that
Guatemozin should be brought before him. He came,
escorted by Sandoval and Holguin, both of whom
claimed the honor of having captured him. The Spanish
conqueror came forward with dignified courtesy to
receive the noble prisoner.</p>

<p>“I have done all that I could to defend myself and
my people,” said Guatemozin. “I am now reduced
to this awful state. Deal with me, Malinche, as you
will.” Then, laying his hand upon a dagger which
hung from the belt of the Spanish invader, he added:
“Better dispatch me at once with this, and rid me of
life.”</p>

<p>Cortés smiled.</p>

<p>“Fear not,” said he. “You will be treated with
honor. You have defended your capital like a brave
warrior, and a Spaniard knows how to respect valor,
even in an enemy.”</p>

<p>In spite of these remarks he treated him with great
cruelty, for, when the city was entered and less treasure
was found there than had been expected, Cortés caused
poor Guatemozin to be tortured. Fire and cord could
not, however, wring the secret of the treasure from this
illustrious Prince. Later on he was hanged, upon the
pretense that he had conspired against the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The Aztec dead were now collected and burned in
huge bonfires. Those who were still alive were allowed
to leave the city, and for three days a mournful train
of men, women, and children straggled feebly across
the causeways, sick and wounded, wasted with famine
and with misery. Again and again they turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
take one more look at the spot which had once been
their home. When they were gone, the Spanish conquerors
took possession of the place and purified it as
speedily as possible, burying those who were not burned
in the bonfires.</p>

<p>The treasures of gold and of jewels which were
found fell far short of the expectations of the conquerors,
for the Aztecs, no doubt, had buried their
hoards, or sunk them in the lake on purpose to disappoint
the avarice of their enemies.</p>

<p>Thus, after three months of continued fighting, the
renowned capital of the Aztecs fell before Cortés and
his men. The Mexicans had put up a courageous fight
and had suffered much, but they had been no match for
the soldiers from Cuba and from Spain.</p>

<p>The Aztecs would not have thus gone down to ruin,
had they not ruthlessly made war upon the neighboring
states, which caused them to be hated. Their human
sacrifices had angered their weaker neighbors, and
thus Cortés had secured the aid of the Tlascalans, without
whose assistance he could never have won the
fight.</p>

<p>Cortés and his Spaniards were now masters of Mexico.
A brave man with equally brave followers had conquered
an entire empire!</p>

<p>And what of the future days of this bold-hearted
explorer? Alas! These were similar to those which
came to Columbus, the Navigator. Poor, forsaken by
the King of Spain, surrounded by persons who were
jealous of his position and his fame, the once rich and
prosperous adventurer died miserably at Castilleja,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Spain, on December second, 1547, at the age of sixty-two.
With him was his devoted son, Martin, a youth
of fifteen.</p>

<p>Cortés was entombed in the land of his birth, but
this was not to be his last resting place, for his remains
were taken across the sea to the country which he had
conquered. He was buried for the second time in the
Franciscan monastery at Tezcuco; then, for a third time,
in the church of St. Francis in the City of Mexico. On
this occasion, which was sixty-seven years after the first
entombment, all the dignitaries of Mexico marched in
procession through the streets of the city. Still again,
in 1794, there was another removal of the General’s
moldering dust to the hospital of Jesus, where a monument
of bronze was erected to his fame and glory.</p>

<p>In 1823 there was yet another disturbance of what
remained of our hero. The previous removals of his
ashes had been inspired by regard, but now a revolutionary
mob of frenzied Mexicans, in order to show its
hatred and detestation of the Spanish conquerors, endeavored
to desecrate the tomb. To prevent this, the
casket, in the dead of night, was secretly carried away
by the Duke of Monteleone, a descendant of Cortés on
the female line, and for more than seventy years remained
in a place of safety. Monteleone, himself, was
killed in one of the many Mexican revolutions, and all
knowledge was lost of the spot where he had hidden the
ashes of the conqueror. Yet, within a few years, the
remains have been discovered and a movement has been
started to have them placed in the national pantheon,
a temple in the City of Mexico, erected to all those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have made great names in the history of this turbulent
republic.</p>

<p>So at last, perhaps, the valiant Cortés will receive the
honor that is due him.</p>

<p class="pch">EXPERT MARINER, WHOSE FOLLOWERS WERE<br />
THE FIRST TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE<br />
THE GLOBE</p>

<p class="pch2">(1480-1521)</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">“COME hither, page, I want you.”</p>

<p>A little boy ran through the corridors of the
palace of King John of Portugal as this cry
rang out, and, kneeling at the feet of the Queen, kissed
her hand.</p>

<p>“That is a good boy,” said Queen Leonora, smiling.
“Ferdinand, I wish to say that you need not accompany
me this afternoon, but can go out hawking.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Your Majesty,” said the little boy, and,
scampering off, he was soon outside the palace, where
some of the men-at-arms took him hunting. This was
much more to his liking than staying near the Queen
and carrying messages for her, which he was expected
to do nearly every day in the week.</p>

<p>Little Ferdinand had been born about the year 1470
at the Villa de Sabroza, which is situated about the
center of that part of Portugal which lies north of the
River Douro. His family was a noble one and consequently
it had been easy for the youth to obtain a
position of page at Court, a position which in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
days, was equivalent to going to boarding-school at the
present time.</p>

<p>In 1470 a page was taught something of the history
of his own country, and a little about the history of
others. He was instructed in Latin,&mdash;enough to enable
him to understand the church service,&mdash;and was
also taught how to read and to write. He was shown
how to use the rapier, the lance, and the arquebus;
how to ride a horse; how to swim and to dance. This
was supposed to constitute the education of a Portuguese
gentleman, and, as there was some rivalry among
the nobles in regard to their respective households, the
retinues of a Count or a Baron quite resembled a modern
boarding-school.</p>

<p>These were days when all eyes were turned upon the
New World and the recent discoveries in America.
Every Portuguese youth was anxious to follow the sea,
perhaps to become a great explorer or navigator. The
discovery of a route to the Indies by a mariner in the
service of Spain had awakened a jealousy in the hearts
of the Portuguese, and all patriotic sailors were anxious
to coast down the African shore, and, if possible, to find
a way to the Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. Young
Ferdinand grew up in this atmosphere, so you can
readily see that he eagerly looked for a chance when he
could leave the court and could become a mariner upon
the wide and surging ocean.</p>

<p>The ambitious Ferdinand did not have to look far, or
long, before he had an opportunity to follow the sea.
We find that he served an apprenticeship under a famous
navigator called Albuquerque, who, although he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
maintained a strict military discipline over his followers,
was wise, humane, and just in his dealings with
them. Young Ferdinand spent much time in the Indies,
where he had an excellent opportunity to study
and learn by experience how to govern men, so, when
Albuquerque was recalled to Portugal, he went with
him, only to find that the King would give him but
slight recognition for his services. This angered the
high-spirited young fellow.</p>

<p>“I will leave the service of such a monarch,” said
he, “and will go to Spain. There, I hear, they know
how to treat a valiant man.”</p>

<p>So, accompanied by one Roy Falero, who had earned
quite a reputation as a geographer and astronomer, he
sought out Charles the Fifth at Seville, proposing that
the King allow him men and money for a journey of
exploration.</p>

<p>“I wish to sail westward,” said he, “and will discover
a new route to the Indies. If your gracious
Majesty will but help me, I will find new lands which
will become the possessions of the Crown of Castile.”</p>

<p>Charles the Fifth, the grandson of Ferdinand and
Isabella, was King of Spain, and also Monarch of
Austria; one crown being his by right of his mother,
the other by inheritance from his father. He was a
man of large ideas, so, when this project was presented
to him, he heartily approved, saying:</p>

<p>“Of course you shall go, and I will give you the
money, the men, and the ships. But all that you discover
must belong to the King of Spain.&mdash;Understand
this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“We do.”</p>

<p>“Then you may sail, and God be with you!”</p>

<p>Five ships were soon fitted out for the expedition.
Their crews numbered two hundred and thirty-seven
men and Ferdinand was commissioned Admiral of the
squadron, a position which pleased him mightily. The
caravels turned southward, and, leaving Seville on
August 10th., 1519, lazed along until they reached the
Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of Africa, where the
ships cast anchor. By and by a trade-wind came along,
and aided by this and by the South Equatorial current,
the vessels made a safe and easy passage across
the Atlantic, to the shore of Brazil.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were delighted with what they saw,
for they found a large, fresh-water river, seventeen
miles across, and at its mouth were seven islands. Going
ashore the sailors saw many brown-skinned natives,
who ran away whenever they approached, yelling like
demons. One of them “had the stature of a giant
and the voice of a bull,” but even he skipped headlong
into the brush as the men from Castile made after
him. When the Spaniards reached the village of these
Brazilians they found the remains of human beings
roasting on their fires. They stood aghast, for these
fellows were cannibals!</p>

<p>The ships were headed southward and languidly
cruised along the coast to Patagonia where the explorers
lingered for two full months, eagerly looking
for precious stones and for human beings. But they
found none of the former and only one of the latter,
this fellow being a giant who came down to the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dancing, singing, and throwing dust over his head.</p>

<p>He was so tall, says an old chronicler of this voyage,
that the head of a middling-sized man reached only to
his waist; he was well-proportioned; his visage was
large and painted with different colors, principally
with yellow. There were red circles about his eyes
and something like a beard was pictured on either
cheek. His hair was colored white and his apparel
was the skin of some beast, laced together, the head of
which appeared to have been very large. It had ears
like a mule, the body of a camel, and the tail of a horse:
the skin of it was wrapped about his feet in the manner
of shoes. In his hand was a short, thick bow and a
bundle of arrows, made of reeds and pointed with sharp
stones.</p>

<p>Magellan invited the giant Patagonian on board his
flagship, and, when the old fellow had mounted the
rope-ladder leading over the side, presented him with
hawk’s bells, a comb, some blue beads, and a looking
glass, into which the dusky-hued savage took a
glance.</p>

<p>“Hu&mdash;rruu!!” No sooner had he seen his own
horrid appearance than he started backwards, with such
violence, that he knocked down two sailors who were
standing behind him. He slipped, fell down on the
deck, and, when he arose, stood there shivering. His
own face, never seen before, had terrorized him. After
awhile he was rowed ashore, still quaking and rolling
his eyes with unpleasant recollections of what he had
seen.</p>

<p>The Spaniards laughed heartily at what had occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but the next day a man of still greater stature
came to visit them. He sang some native songs,
danced on the deck, and brought out some skins which
he traded for glass beads and other trinkets. Then he
disappeared and did not return, which led the voyagers
to the belief that his countrymen had made away with
him because of the friendship which they had shown
towards him.</p>

<p>This did not deter other natives from paddling out
to the ships, and four soon came on board. These were
presented with beads, with bells, and similar trifles.
But the Spaniards determined to trick them, so fastened
iron shackles around the ankles of two of them,
as if for ornaments. The ignorant Indians professed
great delight with the shining bands of metal, but,
when they were ready to leave the vessel, the fraud
was discovered. It was certainly a cruel way to treat
the poor South Americans.</p>

<p>As for the other two, they dove over the side of the
vessel and swam to land, as soon as they perceived
what had happened to their companions, who began to
roar “as loud as bulls,” and implored the assistance
of their God, the great devil Setebos. It was of no
avail. The Spaniards would not let them go and took
them with them when they sailed further south. They
called them Patagonians, for their feet were covered
with skins, and the Portuguese word pata means a hoof
or paw.</p>

<p>Now trouble beset Magellan, the same kind of trouble
which Columbus had with his men. His followers grew
rebellious, and threatened to break into open mutiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Winter was at hand, and the ships were laid up for the
cold weather, but this forced inactivity made the sailors
begin to think about home, and they grew restless
and discontented. They requested their commander
to set sail for Spain, but this he refused to do.
The sailors talked the matter over, and their sense
of oppression grew stronger and stronger. So they
decided to take possession of the ships, put the Admiral
to death, imprison or kill such of the superior officers
as refused to acknowledge the authority of the mutineers,
and to return to Spain with a story that their
commander had been swept overboard in a storm.</p>

<p>The leader of this conspiracy was one Luis de Mendoza,
who was assisted by a Roman Catholic priest,
Juan de Carthagena, who had accompanied the expedition
so that the Spaniards might not be without
spiritual assistance during their roving trips into unknown
seas. Fortunately for the Admiral this plot
was disclosed to him in time to prevent its execution.
He had a trial and found the mutineers guilty. Many
were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.</p>

<p>But the priest was allowed to have his life, for the
Spaniards were too good Catholics to harm any one who
had devoted his days to the Church. Carthagena was
not injured; but was simply put under arrest, guarded
by one of the captains. The man of God was forced
into the stocks: an instrument made of two pieces of
wood placed one upon the other and pierced by two holes
in which were inserted the legs of the person who was to
be punished.</p>

<p>There were many others who were less guilty than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Mendoza, but who were deserving of punishment. To
have retained these on board, after a short period of
imprisonment, was to invite another mutiny, so Magellan
determined to put the remaining mutineers on shore
and leave them to the mercy of the native Patagonians.
They were seated in the boats, were landed, and the
ships sailed southward, never to return.</p>

<p>The men had now been away from Spain for about
a year; the long and cold winter was drawing to a
close; they were plowing towards the south with the
land ever in view upon the starboard. Would they
reach a point where the ships could enter the South Sea
from the Atlantic?</p>

<p>Magellan was determined either to die or to bring
the expedition to a successful conclusion, so one day
he addressed his sailors as follows:</p>

<p>“My men,” said he, “the Emperor has assigned
me to the course which I am to take, and I cannot and
will not depart from it under any pretext whatsoever.
If our provisions grow scarce, you can add to your rations
by fishing and hunting on the land. I <i>will not</i>
put back, under any consideration, and if any of you
speak to me again of this, I will throw you overboard
where the sharks can have a full meal.”</p>

<p>Seeing the determination of their leader the sailors
said nothing more.</p>

<p>The vessels kept onward, and, having reached a point
about fifty-two degrees south of the equator, were
obliged to lay to in a harbor near the shore. The men
secured an ample supply of fish, of fuel, and of fresh
water, and, thus well provided, the prows were again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
turned in a southerly direction. Suddenly the coast
seemed to turn westward. The sailors saw land on
either side of them: sometimes there was scarcely a mile
between coast and islands.</p>

<p>This began to look interesting, as if, at last, they
were nearing that unknown sea for which they searched.
The prows of the caravels were now turned due west,
and, with sails well filled by tempestuous winds, the
Spanish ships plowed onward, ever onward, until they
emerged from among the rocky islands, which surrounded
them, into a broad and peaceful ocean. Hurrah!
Magellan had entered the gray waters of that
sea which Balboa had seen from the palm-clad hills
of the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p>It was a warm, still day when the caravels forged
ahead through the straits which were ever afterwards
to bear the name of this Spanish adventurer, and, remembering
the dreary winter upon the coast of Patagonia,
Magellan named the ocean the Pacific, for all
seemed beauty and peace after the troublous times
which had passed. His men scrambled ashore, erected
a huge cross, and called the place Cape Desire, a name
well suited to their hopes of finding a route to India
with its treasures of gems and of spices.</p>

<p>There was trouble in store for them, in spite of the
pacific greeting which the vast ocean had given them.
Turning westward and northward, for three long
months the caravels tossed upon the oily swells with
no sight of land. All the provisions were finally consumed
and the water casks were almost empty. Food
was obtained by soaking old leather in sea-water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
soften it, and so weak were many of the sailors that
they could not perform their duties. Nineteen died,
including the two Patagonians.</p>

<p>But the ocean was truly pacific, it was like glass.
No storms threatened, no tempests alarmed them, and,
after sailing four thousand miles, the adventurers suddenly
were cheered by the sight of land. Eagerly they
drew near and went ashore, only to find two small,
treeless, and uninhabited islands which they called the
Unfortunate Isles. Certainly these sea rovers were
having a rough time of it!</p>

<p>The Spaniards were upon the outskirts of Polynesia,
and, as they sailed onward, soon came upon a number
of islands where they obtained plenty of food from the
dusky-hued natives who eagerly swarmed around them
in skin boats. The islanders also stole everything
which they could get their hands on, including one of
the long boats, which they paddled ashore and hid near
their village. This angered the men from Castile exceedingly,
so they determined to punish the Polynesians,
and that right quickly.</p>

<p>Arming themselves, and putting on their steel helmets
and breastplates, the Spaniards now went ashore,
shot at the natives with their guns, drove them from
their village, smashed their canoes, and burned their
huts. After killing seven of the yelping brown-skins,
they seized their lost boat, rowed it back to the ship,
hoisted sail, and left for other scenes. Magellan revenged
himself further by calling these islands the
<i>Insular Latronum</i>, or “Islands of Thieves.” They
are now called the Ladrones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the month of March, 1521. The air was
balmy and the navigators much enjoyed the sight of
many beauteous islands in the South Sea. They landed
upon one of them, pitched a tent for the accommodation
of the sick, and killed a stout porker which they had
obtained from the thieving natives. After their diet
of leather, soaked in sea water, this fresh meat was
appreciated. In fact they had a good, old-fashioned
banquet, such as one is accustomed to on Thanksgiving
day. After this they chanted the <i>Te Deum</i>
and had a siesta beneath the shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>They had remained here about a week when nine
men came paddling up in a canoe, and brought presents
of cocoa-wine and some golden trinkets. These were
eagerly accepted, and the visitors rowed away, promising
by signs to return in four days with flesh, fowls,
and rice. This promise they kept, and, when they arrived,
offered to exchange various kinds of spices and
articles made of gold, for the beads and trinkets which
the Spaniards showed them. Magellan wished to impress
the natives with his reserve power, so he ordered
one of the cannon to be discharged, while the visitors
were on board his vessel. This so frightened them that
they ran to the gunwale in order to jump into the sea.
The sailors interfered, and, assuring them of the friendliness
of the Admiral, soon had them quieted.</p>

<p>Leaving this island behind them, the Spaniards now
steered west and southwest, and, after a run of three
days, anchored near a large body of land which was
inhabited by a tribe of brown-skinned natives, who
seemed to be well-disposed towards these strange foreigners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Magellan presented the King with a red and
yellow garment made long and flowing, and gave his
principal courtiers knives and glass beads.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were well received by these people,
so well received, in fact, that the King of the island offered
to furnish them with pilots when they wished to
sail away. This offer was accepted, and, steering westward,
they soon reached another island, called Zubut,
where they learned that a vessel manned by a Portuguese
crew, and having a cargo of gold and of slaves,
had anchored opposite the capital only the day before
Magellan’s arrival, and had offered tribute to the King.
Rendered bold by this deference, the native proceeded
to exact tribute from Magellan, informing him that
all who came to his dominions were obliged to pay it.</p>

<p>“I cannot pursue the same course that these Portuguese
have done,” answered Magellan. “For the King
of Portugal is a far less powerful monarch than he whom
I serve, for my Emperor has such power that his subjects
pay tribute to no one. If, therefore, you persist in
your claim, you may find yourself involved in a war
with one who will crush you at the first conflict.”</p>

<p>These words made the bold native reflect, and, as a
Moorish trader, who was present, informed him that
what he told him was the truth, the monarch asked for a
day in which to consider his answer to Magellan’s
refusal. In the meantime he entertained the sailors
right royally.</p>

<p>While deliberating how to gracefully withdraw from
the arrogant position which he had assumed, the savage
ruler was visited by the native monarch who had accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Magellan on board his ship from the island
which he had recently visited. This fellow spoke so
well of the Admiral that his words had great weight
with the proud islander. The demand for tribute was
withdrawn, and the people of the island entered eagerly
into traffic with the newcomers, who became missionaries
and preached the Christian faith with so much
earnestness, that, within a very short time, the whole
territory was converted to the religion of Jesus Christ.
The native idols were destroyed and crosses were
erected in many places.</p>

<p>After a lengthy stay at this island, the Spaniards
again went on board their ships, and, sailing away,
reached the Philippine Islands, which were called
Mathan by the natives. Here were two native rulers,
Tual and Cilapulapu, whom Magellan summoned to
pay tribute to the King of Spain. The first acceded
to his demand, the second refused indignantly to do so.</p>

<p>This roused the hot blood of the Castilian adventurer,
and he determined to enforce his claim with cold
steel. He, therefore, chose sixty of his bravest men,
armed them with coats of mail and steel helmets, and,
taking to the boats, soon landed. They marched inland
in order to chastise this independent ruler.</p>

<p>Cilapulapu had hastily collected all of his fighting
men, arranged them in three divisions, and awaited the
oncoming Spaniards. His soldiers were many&mdash;there
were two thousand in each division, or six thousand in
all&mdash;armed with spears, lances, darts, javelins, and
arrows dipped in poison. The Spaniards little knew
what they were marching against, yet, like Custer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the Little Big Horn, they kept on moving. And, like
Custer, there was soon to be an equally severe defeat.</p>

<p>The mail-clad Castilians advanced boldly through the
jungle to where the enemy was lying concealed, and
there a shower of arrows beat down upon them, rattling
like hail upon their steel coats. Many of the barbs
were turned aside, but some penetrated the joints of the
armor, and, entering the skin of the Spaniards, sent the
deadly poison coursing through their veins.</p>

<p>Magellan urged on his followers by voice and waving
sword, but, as he led the advance, a sharp barb penetrated
a joint of his armor, and forced the deadly
poison into his blood. The enemy now rushed in on
every side, in overwhelming numbers, and showered
their javelins upon the sixty brave soldiers of Castile.
The wounded leader bravely endeavored to direct his
men, in spite of his injury, but, as he shouted his battle-cry,
a cane-lance struck him full in the face. The blow
was fatal and he sank dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>His soldiers were now almost surrounded. Eight of
them were killed, the rest retreated (as best they
might) to the beach, leaving the body of their dead
leader in the hands of the exultant savages, who made
the air hideous with their exultant battle-cries.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>So died the brave Portuguese navigator, on an island
which was to belong to the Spanish Crown for many,
many years. He had fallen as he had always wished to
do, in the front of battle, and, although his followers
endeavored to secure his body from the wild Filipinos,
they were unable to do so. Their emissary to
the barbarous Cilapulapu was murdered by this wily
monarch, and, seeing that it was impossible to remain
longer in this region, the navigators sailed away, bitterly
cursing their misfortune in losing such a brave
and courageous leader.</p>

<p class="p2">Reduced to forty-six in number, the survivors of this
expedition of adventure and discovery continued their
journey among the various islands of Polynesia until
February, 1522, when they passed the extremity of
Molucca, and, keeping outside of Sumatra, sailed due
west toward the eastern coast of Africa. Twenty-one
of the forty-six died of hunger before they reached the
Cape Verde Islands, where, sending deputies ashore
to represent their pitiable condition to the Portuguese
authorities, they were allowed some rice, which was
quickly disposed of. Thirteen of the sailors went on
shore again to secure a further supply of provisions,
but the Portuguese considered that they had done quite
enough for them, so seized them and threw them into
prison. The others, panic-stricken, hoisted sail, and,
without endeavoring to release their companions, set out
for their beloved Spain.</p>

<p>On September the seventh, 1522, twelve miserable-looking
Spanish sailors landed at the port of St. Lucar,
near Seville. They were ragged, bare-foot, and gaunt
from hunger. Proceeding to the Cathedral, they sank
to their knees and thanked God for their preservation,
for, out of the two hundred and thirty-seven who had
sailed gayly away from Seville more than three years
before, these were all that remained to tell the tale.</p>

<p>And it was a pretty good tale they had to tell, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
they had been the first white men to circumnavigate
the globe. But the bones of their gallant leader lay
among the wild and bloodthirsty natives of the Philippine
Islands, with not even a stone to mark the last
resting place of the brave and energetic Portuguese
mariner.</p>

<h2 class="p4">GIOVANNI VERRAZANO:</h2>

<p class="pch">FIRST NAVIGATOR TO EXPLORE THE<br />
COAST OF NEW JERSEY AND<br />
NEW YORK.</p>
<p class="pch2">(1480-1527)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was a calm, still day off the coast of Spain. A
light, southerly breeze rippled the surface of the
water, and, if you had been standing on the Cape
St. Vincent, you would have seen the sails of six vessels
which were headed for the shore. If you had been
nearer, you would have seen that here were three Spanish
galleons of war and three treasure ships from far
distant Hispaniola, on the Isthmus of Panama. They
were loaded with gold, with silver, and with spices,
which had been sent to the King of Spain by Hernando
Cortés, conqueror of Montezuma and the Mexican
people.</p>

<p>But, ah! what is this!</p>

<p>As the treasure ships and their convoys approached
the shore, suddenly a fleet of six vessels could be seen
boiling along under full canvas, and rushing to meet
them. They were armed corsairs under Juan Florin,
fitted out at New Rochelle, in France, and having on
board a man who was to have some prominence in later
years, as he was to be the first European to view the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
broad salt marshes of New Jersey. This was Giovanni
Verrazano, a Florentine navigator, who, like all the
mariners in those days, was a sea robber, a pirate, and
an explorer.</p>

<p>The Spanish ships were about thirty-five miles from
the shore, and rollicked along right merrily, under a
full spread of canvas. Their steermen thought, no
doubt, that these were friendly vessels coming to greet
them and to convoy them home. But in an hour they
found out their mistake. The flag of France flew defiantly
at the mast-heads of the oncoming galleons, and,
as they drew near, cannon were trained upon the
Spaniards and balls began to fly dangerously close.
One of the treasure ships turned around and took flight,
but the others had to fight it out.</p>

<p>Now was a sharp little battle. Around and around
went the boats, banging away at a good rate; but the
French corsairs were accurate marksmen and were
keen to win, for they longed for all that Mexican gold.
At the end of two hours’ time the French were alongside,
had boarded, and the yellow flag of Spain came
fluttering to the decks of the galleons from the coast
of Mexico. The treasure of Cortés was to find a safe
home on the shores of Merrie France.</p>

<p>The King of Spain was deeply grieved to hear of this
loss and thereupon ordered all homeward-bound vessels
to rendezvous at Hispaniola, in order to be safely convoyed
to Spain. He also offered one-half of the treasure
captured to any Spaniard who would chase the
French and get back that which had been stolen. Hernando
Cortés, too, was greatly disappointed when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
heard of this loss, but he took measure to avoid such
mishaps in the future. As for Verrazano: he reaped
such a large share of this treasure, that he soon owned
some vessels of his own.</p>

<p>For several years this Florentine corsair, now sailing
under the flag of France, made it a business to lie in
wait for treasure ships coming from Mexico, and the
West Indies, to the shores of Spain. He did well, captured
many a prize, and on one occasion took a Portuguese
ship bringing from the Indies a freight valued
at 180,000 ducats. He grew rich and prosperous, and,
as he was of an adventurous disposition, determined to,
himself, sail to the New World, and make an attempt to
find that passage to Cathay, for which all European
navigators were then searching. The Spaniards, at
this time, had just about given up all hope of finding
Asia connected with the continent of North America.</p>

<p>In the year 1522, with four ships, Verrazano turned
his face towards America and started across the Atlantic.
But fierce storms beset his path; he was driven
back to the coast of Brittany, where his vessels, badly
damaged by wind and waves, were refitted. After this
he gathered a fleet of armed caravels, cruised southward
into Spanish waters, took several prizes, and then returned.
This was in the Spring of 1524. He then
determined to sail for the land of America, in one ship,
the <i>Dauphine</i>. He took fifty men, with ammunition,
arms, and stores sufficient to last them for eight months,
and turned the prow of the trim little vessel towards the
west.</p>

<p>Heading straight across the broad Atlantic, Verrazano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and his Frenchmen passed north of the Bermuda
Islands, and, drifting northward in the Gulf
Stream, sighted land about the sixth day of March.
Many fires were seen on the beach, made by the Indians,
who flocked to the shore at this season to feast on shell
fish and to manufacture <i>wampum</i>, or shell money.
The explorers were off the coast of New Jersey, probably
near Cape May.</p>

<p>Verrazano was much pleased to see that he had
reached the shores of America and ordered a boat to
land. As the sailors scrambled up on the sandy beach,
a number of natives came down to the shore; but fled
as the white men approached, sometimes stopping, and
turning about, gazing with much curiosity at the white-skinned
navigators. Being reassured by signs that
they would not be injured, some of them came near,
and, looking with wonder at the dress and complexions
of the foreigners, offered them food. This was accepted,
and then the sailors returned to their vessel.</p>

<p>The explorers sailed northward, again landed, and,
going inland, found this to be a country full of very
great forests. They marveled at the many trees and
shrubs which stretched away in unbroken splendor.
Verrazano was undoubtedly in the harbor of New
York, at this time, and saw Shrewsbury River, the
Kills, and the Narrows. He says: “The land has
many lakes and ponds of fresh water, with numerous
kinds of birds adapted to all the pleasures of the chase.
The winds do not blow fiercely in these regions and
those which prevail are northwest and west.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving New York harbor, the explorers followed the
coastline, and sailed along the shores of Long Island,
where they saw many great fires made by the native
inhabitants. Approaching the beach in order to get
water, the Captain ordered the boat to land, with
twenty-five men, but there was such high surf that it
was impossible to do so. Many Indians came down to
the sand, making friendly signs, and pointing to where
the white men might gain a footing.</p>

<p>Rockaway Bay was a great resort of the Indians for
the purpose of manufacturing <i>wampum</i> or <i>seawan</i>, the
money of the native Americans. Numerous shell beds
now line the shore where the manufacture was carried
on. The navigators must have therefore landed on
Rockaway Beach, where the shore-line meets the narrow
and barren outer-bar, which for over seventy miles
separates the ocean from the bay, or lagoons, behind it.</p>

<p>Still coasting along, the keen Verrazano went ashore
again near Quogue or Bridgehampton, where he
found the place full of forests of various kinds of
woods, but not as odoriferous as those on the Jersey
shore; the country being more northerly and colder.
Here the Indians again fled into the thickets, as the
white men approached, but the Frenchmen saw many
of their boats, made of a single log twenty feet long and
four feet wide, hollowed out with sharp knives and
axes.</p>

<p>After remaining here three days, the navigators departed,
running along the coast in a northerly direction,
sailing by day and dropping anchor at night. At the
end of a journey of a hundred miles they found a very
pleasant place, indeed, where a large river, deep at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
mouth, ran into the sea between high cliffs upon either
side. The explorers proceeded up the curving stream
in a boat and soon found themselves surrounded by the
redskins in canoes, these natives being dressed with bird
feathers of gay colors. They came towards the Frenchmen,
joyfully, and emitted great shouts of admiration.</p>

<p>The sailors ascended the river for about half a mile,
“where,” says Verrazano, “we saw a fine lake about
three miles in circumference through which were passing
many canoes of the red men.” But a violent wind
sprang up, so that the explorers had to return to their
ships, “leaving the land,” continues Verrazano, “with
much regret, as the hills there showed minerals.” The
navigators had entered the river Thames, the vessel
being anchored well within Fisher’s Island, where
many a steam-yacht would afterwards cast its anchor,
while the sailors would watch the rival crews of Yale
and Harvard, as they battled for supremacy on the
waters of the shimmering stream.</p>

<p>But the navigators would not remain to make friends
with the Indians, and, weighing anchor, sailed eastward,
where they saw an island, triangular in form,
distant about ten miles from the mainland, full of hills
and covered with trees. Judging from the fires which
they viewed along the shore, the Frenchmen considered
it to be thickly inhabited. This was Block Island, but
the sunburned explorers called it Louisa Island, after
the mother of King Francis the First, of far distant
France.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles from Block Island is Narragansett
Bay, and hither the <i>Dauphine</i> was headed, anchoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
first at its mouth, then between Goat Island and the
present town of Newport. Immediately the vessel was
surrounded by canoes, filled with wondering savages,
who at first did not venture to approach the ships, but,
stopping about fifty paces away, gazed in silent admiration
at the strange object which had risen, as if by
magic, before them. Then, all of a sudden, they broke
into a loud shout of joy.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen crowded to the rail, reassuring the
natives and imitating their gestures. The Indians
therefore, came nearer, and, as they approached, the
navigators threw them bells, mirrors, and other trinkets,
which they picked up, laughing, and then paddled up
to the sides of the great hulk. Catching hold of the
gunwales with their hands, they crawled up on the
deck, saying: “Ugh! Ugh!”</p>

<p>Among the visitors were two kings, one of whom
seemed to be about forty, the other twenty-four years
of age. The elder was arrayed in a robe of deer skins,
skillfully wrought with rich embroidery; his head was
bare and his hair was carefully tied behind him; his
neck was adorned by a large chain, set off with various
colored stones. The dress of the younger monarch was
nearly like that of his elder companion.</p>

<p>The followers of these kings crowded around them,
“and,” says Verrazano, “they were the most beautiful
and genteel-mannered people I had met in all the voyage.”
Their complexions were remarkably clear; their
features regular, their hair long, and dressed with no
ordinary degree of care; their eyes black and lively.
Their whole aspect was pleasing, and their profiles reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the Frenchmen of the busts of the ancients.
The wives and daughters of the native Narragansetts
were not allowed to come on board, and had to wait for
their husbands in the canoes. These, too, were richly
dressed in deer and beaver skins. The early inhabitants
of Newport, it seems, were as gaudily arrayed as
were their white-skinned descendants to be many centuries
later.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen lingered here for more than two
weeks, while Verrazano made numerous trips into the
many estuaries of Narragansett Bay, finding a pleasant
country with all kinds of cultivation going on. Corn
was being grown; wine and oil were being manufactured
by the native inhabitants. The corsair was particularly
struck with the total ignorance shown by the
natives of the value of gold, and the preference which
they gave for beads and for toys, over more costly
objects. So, in trade, he was able to get many valuable
furs and skins for a few, shining, glass beads.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the charms of the scenery and the
pleasant reception given him by the friendly Narragansett
Indians, the Frenchmen decided to continue their
journey northward. So, leaving Newport behind them,
the <i>Dauphine</i> was steered along the coast. The vessel
passed around south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket,
and, steering well clear of Cape Cod, lazed
along the rocky shore of Massachusetts near Cape Ann.</p>

<p>Occasionally the explorers landed in their boat, finding
dense woods of pines and hemlocks. The natives
seemed to be quite different, also, from those farther
south, for, while the southerners had been gentle in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
behavior, these were more barbarous and rough. They
were dressed in the skins of bears, wolves, and foxes,
and, although the Frenchmen endeavored to hold conversation
with them, this was found to be impossible,
as they would run into the forest whenever the white
men approached.</p>

<p>Finally, somewhere between Cape Ann and Nahant&mdash;probably
where the Myopia Hunt Club now rests in
peaceful seclusion&mdash;twenty-five of the explorers went
inland for two or three miles, seeing many natives, who
would not be friendly, and, when they returned to the
shore, the primitive sons of Massachusetts shot at the
interlopers with their bows and arrows, shouting loudly
as they did so. Many of the redskins had copper
rings in their ears. The forests were very dense hereabouts,
and the savages hid themselves whenever the
white men turned to fight.</p>

<p>Not pleased with their reception, the navigators
coasted northward, passed the rocky promontory of
Cape Ann, the wind-ripped Isles of Shoals, and finally
reached Portland Harbor. They were charmed with
the magnificent scenery, and, coasting along the hemlock-clad
shores, passed thirty-two islands, all lying
near the rocky beach, which impressed the voyagers
greatly with their beauty. But alas! provisions now
began to fail, and it was time to hark back to France.</p>

<p>All the crew were well and happy, for they had had
a wonderful trip along the coastline of America, then
unspoiled by the erection of houses, towns, and villages.</p>

<p>On board was an Indian boy, whom they had kidnaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and he, too, seemed to be well and contented.
When off the Jersey coast, Verrazano had landed and
had journeyed about two miles into the interior, with
about twenty of the crew. The natives had fled to the
forest; but two,&mdash;a young girl and an old woman, less
fortunate than the rest,&mdash;had been overtaken by the
Europeans. The Frenchmen seized the girl, and also
a boy of about eight years of age, who had been hanging
on the back of the old woman. Then, they began to
retrace their steps to the sea.</p>

<p>As they proceeded, the girl made a vigorous resistance,
and set up violent cries of rage and terror. She
clawed with her nails, struck with her hands, and struggled
to free herself. At last, wearied with the attempt
to transport this virago, the Frenchmen let her go,
keeping the boy as a less troublesome, though less valued
prize. The girl bounded away into the forest like a
deer, and was soon lost in the shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>The <i>Dauphine</i> was now somewhere near the mouth
of the beautiful Penobscot River, in Maine. It was
the end of June and the breath from the hemlock forests
along the shore was filled with the scent of the balsam
bough. Verrazano would have lingered longer in this
lovely country, but the object of the voyage had now
been accomplished; over seven hundred leagues of the
new world had been explored, and the French corsair
had held sufficient communication with the native redskins
to form some idea of their state and character.</p>

<p>The bow of the <i>Dauphine</i> was therefore turned towards
France; she made a safe passage, propelled by
favorable winds, and, in the month of July, 1524, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
five and a half months after her departure, Verrazano,
the corsair, landed at Dieppe. The Indian boy was
well, and he was taken ashore: but what happened to
him afterwards is not known.</p>

<p>The adventurous explorer now wrote a letter to the
King of France telling of the land which he had discovered
and of the Indians and wild beasts which he
had seen. To Francis the First, the French Monarch,
he offered a vast province in the temperate latitude, on
which France might well have expended her enterprise,
and which would have repaid her efforts a thousand
fold. But, alas! France was then in dreadful straits,
for she was near annihilation from her recent struggles
with Germany. The King was a prisoner in the
hands of the Emperor; his army had been dispersed;
his treasury was exhausted.</p>

<p>Thus the vast and fruitful land of America was left
to the English and the Dutch to explore, to colonize,
and to subdue. Could the rough, old corsair have seen
in dreams the beach of Atlantic City, four centuries
later, with its board walk, its towering hotels, its thousands
of bathers, and its wheeled chairs, he would have,
indeed, been surprised, for the old fellow was the first
European who had seen the surf on the shelving sands
of New Jersey.</p>

<p class="pch">CONQUEROR OF PERU.</p>

<p class="pch">(1475-1538)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THERE was a Spaniard once, who lived in
Panama and who had the high sounding name
of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa.</p>

<p>Like all of the adventurers in the early days, he was
ever on the lookout for gold. Do you wonder, therefore,
that his brown eyes glittered and gleamed when
an Indian chief came to him and said:</p>

<p>“If this yellow gold is what you prize so greatly that
you are willing to leave your home and risk even life
itself, for it, then I can tell you of a land where they
eat and drink out of golden vessels, and gold is as common
with the natives as iron is with you.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that the keen Balboa eagerly
inquired where this place was to be found. And the
Indian, sweeping his hand toward the South, said:
“It is there,&mdash;Peru, the land of the Incas!”</p>

<p>The Spaniard did not forget what the native had
said, and he told it to some of his friends, among
whom was a young adventurer by the name of Francisco
Pizarro, who had been sent to Panama to traffic with
the natives for pearls. This fellow, who was a distant
kinsman of Hernando Cortés, conqueror of Mexico, was
a true adventurer; but he was the least educated of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Spaniards who have made names for themselves in
the New World. He had, indeed, been employed as a
swine-herd near the city of Truxillo, in Spain, where
he had been born. He could neither read nor write
with any fluency. From childhood he had been neglected
and had been left to make a living as best he
might.</p>

<p>We know that he sailed away from Seville, in Spain,
when quite a young man, and that he embarked, with
other adventurers, to find his fortune in the New
World. We hear of him in Hispaniola, and, later on,
know that he was employed by Balboa in several enterprises.
He seems to have been ever on the lookout for
adventure and anxious to mend his fortunes, which were
so low, indeed, that, when he heard of this land of gold,
he had not the means to fit out a ship in order to sail
thither and find out whether or not what the native had
said was true. Still, the matter rankled in his mind,
so that he, at length, found a way to go where was
wealth, fame, and fortune.</p>

<p>There were two people in eastern Panama who knew
young Pizarro, and who decided that, perhaps, there
was some truth in what the Indian had said about the
land of the Incas.</p>

<p>“I wish to go there,” said the Spaniard. “If you
will assist and aid me, we may be all wealthy together.”</p>

<p>“That sounds well,” answered Hernando de Luque,
one of these friends, “and I believe that I will give
you the necessary funds, so that you may fit out a
ship.”</p>

<p>The other friend, named Diego Almagro, was also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
badly educated individual, but he was one who eagerly
listened to tales of adventure. A compact was thus
made between these three, most of the money being supplied
by De Luque, Almagro undertaking the equipment
of the ship, and Pizarro taking command of the
expedition. It was difficult to get men to join in such
a venture, but eventually about a hundred were obtained,
mostly idlers in the colony who eagerly grasped
at anything that would mend their broken fortunes.
They were a rough lot.</p>

<p>Everything was finally ready for the journey to that
fabled land of Peru, so Pizarro set sail with his following
of ne’er-do-wells in a large ship, some time during
the month of November, 1524. Almagro followed in a
second vessel, with the rest of the Panama ruffians, and
thus began a movement which was to bring a rich and
populous region beneath the banner of Castile.</p>

<p>Pizarro and his friends embarked at a most unfavorable
time of the year, for it was the rainy season, and
the coast was swept by violent tempests. They had no
knowledge of this fact and consequently kept on until
they reached the Puerto de Piñas, or Port of Pines, a
headland upon the other side of which was a little
river. The ship was brought to anchor and the crew
landed in order to explore the country, but the Spanish
adventurers found only thick, impenetrable forests, and
deep swamplands which were filled with quagmire and
with fever. So they returned to the ship, exhausted;
hoisted sail, and proceeded again upon their voyage to
the southland. They met with a succession of fearful
storms which buffeted their vessel so severely that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
began to leak. Their stock of food and water became
nearly spent, and the members of the expedition had to
subsist upon two ears of Indian corn a day. In this
dreadful condition they were only too glad to turn back,
and anchor, again, a few leagues from the place where
they had first hauled down their sails.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were now in a desperate state of mind,
for the food supply was about gone, and, upon the
shore, all that they could discover were a few unwholesome
berries. So the ship was sent back to Panama in
order to lay in a fresh stock of provisions, while
Pizarro, himself, with about half of his company, made
a further attempt to explore the country. The climate
was hot and enervating, so that more than twenty men
died of fever, but the energetic Pizarro kept on, and at
last succeeded in reaching a clearing where stood a
small Indian village.</p>

<p>To the half-starved Spaniards this was a godsend,
indeed, and, rushing forward, they broke into the rude
huts and seized what food was there to be found; which
they devoured ravenously. The natives dispersed into
the woods, but, seeing that the white-skins offered them
no violence, they came back and, by means of signs,
began to converse with these haggard adventurers.
There was a rich country lying far to the south, said
they, where the people had much gold. They, themselves,
wore large ornaments of the shining metal, and
this the Spaniards eagerly gazed upon, for it was substantial
evidence that the precious material could be
found at no far distant place.</p>

<p>Cheered, but miserable, the adventurers camped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
here for six weary weeks, when the ship returned with
provisions. Those on board were horrified at the gaunt
and haggard faces of their comrades, who looked like
wild men, and who fell upon the provisions as if they
had never before seen food. They soon revived, and,
embarking once more, sailed southward along the coast,
and away from that dismal and cheerless spot, which
they named the Port of Famine.</p>

<p>The vessel crept along near the shore, and the Spaniards
again landed, when they saw an Indian village
among the trees. The inhabitants fled into the forest
as the white-skinned men approached, leaving behind
them a goodly store of corn and other food, and also a
number of gold ornaments of considerable value. The
adventurers found that these were a race of cannibals,
for human flesh was roasting before a fire near one of
the huts. So they hastened back to their ship, with no
cheerful feelings, and again set sail, touching here and
there upon the shore, where they found bold and
warlike natives, who showed no disposition to be
friendly.</p>

<p>Almagro, meanwhile, had succeeded in equipping a
small caravel, and had followed in Pizarro’s wake with
about seventy men. At different places he touched the
shore, even as Pizarro had done, and had several severe
fights with the natives, in one of which he was struck
in the forehead by a javelin, which deprived him of the
sight of one eye. Nothing daunted by this mishap, he
kept on down the coast, collected considerable gold, and
finally gained tidings of his friend Pizarro, whom he
came upon at a seaport called Chicama. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
adventurous commanders embraced with much fervor,
and each told the other of his many exciting encounters
with the natives. They both were sure that they had
not yet gone far enough to the southward, and, after a
long consultation, Pizarro decided to join with Almagro,
and return to Panama for more men, more arms,
and better supplies.</p>

<p>Alas! when the adventurous sea rovers reached
Panama, the Governor lent an unwilling ear to all of
their schemes.</p>

<p>“You have wasted men and money enough already,”
said he. “Away with you!”</p>

<p>But here the friendly De Luque interposed, and, by
the payment of a large sum, was able to buy off this
official interference with future explorations. A contract
was now drawn up and signed between De Luque,
Pizarro and Almagro, whereby the two latter agreed to
pursue the undertaking until the treasures of Peru were
discovered, and were to divide all the lands, gold, jewels,
or treasures equally between the three, in consideration
for further sums which De Luque was to furnish for
more ships and provisions. Should the expedition fail
utterly, De Luque was to be repaid with every bit of
property which the two sea-captains might possess.
Two large and strong vessels were now engaged, and,
procuring a few horses and one hundred and sixty men,
the second expedition was started for the fabled land
of promise.</p>

<p>There was to be no easy or garland-strewn road to
success. One of their ships, under an experienced
pilot called Ruiz, sailed on ahead, leaving Pizarro with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a number of his men at a place on the sea-coast, which
seemed to be healthful, and in an excellent position for
defense. A good deal of treasure had been gathered as
the adventurers coasted along, and this was sent back to
Panama, under the care of Almagro, who was instructed
to bring reënforcements. By the exhibition of the
gold, which had been discovered, it was hoped to tempt
other Spaniards to this hazardous adventure.</p>

<p>Ruiz had a successful voyage. He sailed across the
equinoctial line and entered a great bay, called the Bay
of St. Matthew, where he found the natives hospitable,
and somewhat afraid of these white-skinned strangers,
in their curious house, which floated upon the blue
water. The people wore robes of a woolen cloth of fine
texture, dyed in brilliant colors, and embroidered with
figures of birds and of flowers. They had a pair of
balances for weighing gold and silver, a utensil never
seen before among the natives of South America, and
told him that they possessed large flocks of llamas, or
Peruvian sheep, from which their wool was obtained,
and also, that, in the palaces of their rulers, gold and
silver was as common as wood. Ruiz took several of
the most intelligent natives on board, in order to teach
them Spanish, so that they could act as interpreters,
and then sailed back to the place where he had left
Pizarro and his men.</p>

<p>He arrived in the very nick of time, because the
Spaniards had met with nothing but disaster. They
had journeyed into the interior, hoping to find treasure
and populous cities, only to become lost in dense forests
of gigantic tropical vegetation. Many were waylaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and killed by lurking natives; some died of fever; and
all suffered great privation and distress. Hideous
snakes and alligators infested the many swamps which
they came across; so, discouraged and depressed, they
had retreated to the sea-coast, only to be so tormented
by swarms of mosquitoes, that they had to bury themselves
in the sand, in order to rid themselves of the pests.
Harried by fear of starvation, and worn out by suffering,
they wished to go no farther; but to sail immediately
for Panama. Luckily, at this juncture, Almagro
returned with a goodly supply of provisions, and
with eighty new adventurers, whose enthusiasm speedily
revived the drooping spirits of Pizarro’s men.</p>

<p>Sailing southward, under the pilotage of Ruiz, they
again reached the Bay of St. Matthew, and cast anchor
opposite the Peruvian town of Tacamez, which was
swarming with natives who wore many ornaments of
gold and of silver. Nearby flowed a river, called the
River of Emeralds, because of the quantities of the gems
which were dug from its banks, and, when the Spaniards
heard of the vast stores of these gems which the
natives had gathered, they were eager to come into
possession of them.</p>

<p>With this thought in view, they landed, but were
immediately surrounded by nearly ten thousand natives,
who were well-armed, and seemed to be hostile. The
adventurers were helpless; but, just as they expected to
be assaulted, one of their number was thrown from his
horse, and this caused a great commotion among the
Peruvians.</p>

<p>“See,” they cried, “what was all in one part has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
divided, so that it is now two portions. Make way for
the sorcerers!”</p>

<p>A lane was immediately opened for the Castilians,
and down this, with thankful hearts, they retreated to
their boats.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Almagro returned in one of the
ships to Panama, for it was plain that they could never
gain any treasure from these natives by force, unless
they had a greater number of soldiers. Pizarro chose
a small island as his headquarters until the return of
his comrade; but this decision caused great discontent
among his men, and many of them wrote to friends in
Panama bewailing their condition, and begging them to
use their influence with the Governor to send speedy
relief. As Almagro did his best to seize all letters
directed to Panama, one of these was hidden in a ball
of cotton, and sent as a present to the wife of the Governor.
It was signed by several soldiers, who begged
that a ship be sent to rescue them from the dismal isle
before they should all die of starvation and exposure.
This epistle reached its proper destination, and, when
the Governor viewed the haggard faces of Almagro’s
men, he determined, in his own mind, that the few ill-fated
survivors of the expedition were being detained
by Pizarro, against their will, and upon a desolate
island. He was also angered by the number of lives
which had already been lost, and the money which had
been spent upon the unsuccessful expedition to the land
of the Peruvians. Consequently he refused to help
Almagro further, and, instead of this, sent off two
ships to bring back every Spanish adventurer who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
then with Pizarro. The vessels were commanded by a
certain Captain Tafur.</p>

<p>The followers of Pizarro were overjoyed to see two
well-provisioned ships come to their assistance, and
were quite ready to return to Panama; but Pizarro received
letters from both Almagro and the priest, De
Luque, begging him to hold fast to his purpose. They
furthermore advised him that they would come to his
assistance in a very short time.</p>

<p>Now occurred a famous incident in the career of this
noted explorer, an incident as famous as the passage
of the Rubicon by Julius Cæsar, and of the Alps by the
redoubtable Napoleon Bonaparte. Pizarro, indeed,
was determined to press on, for he had in him an adventurous
soul and the wealth which he had seen at the
Bay of St. Matthew had fired his zeal and cupidity.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said he to his men, “I understand that
many of you would put back from this hazardous enterprise.
As for me, I intend to go onward.”</p>

<p>Then, seizing his sword, he drew a line upon the
sand from east to west, for all were collected upon the
beach.</p>

<p>“On this side,” he continued, pointing to the south,
“are toil, hunger, the drenching storm, desertion, and
death; on that side, ease and pleasure. Here lies Peru
with its riches; there is Panama and its poverty!
Choose each man what best becomes a brave Castilian!
For my part I go to the south!”</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped across the line and was quickly
followed by Ruiz, Pedro de Candia, and eleven other
adventurous souls. The remainder made no movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
so Tafur sailed away with them, next day, leaving a
goodly portion of his provisions to help out those who
determined to cast their fortunes with the danger-loving
Pizarro.</p>

<p>Now, constructing a raft, the adventurous Castilian
transported his men to an island which lay farther
north. There were pheasants and rabbits here, and
also swarms of gnats, flies and mosquitoes. The rain
fell incessantly, and, although the Spaniards built rude
huts in order to keep out the water, they had hard work
to be comfortable. For seven months they thus lived,
until Almagro arrived from Panama, with only just
enough men on board to work the vessel, and with commands
from the Governor for Pizarro to report immediately
at the Isthmus.</p>

<p>In spite of this mandate, the adventurous Spaniards
headed the vessel for the southern coast, soon came in
view of a great gulf, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and saw,
far above them, the snowy crests of the towering mountains:
the Cordilleras. Between these and the sea-coast,
lay a narrow strip of land, which was highly cultivated
by the natives. Some of these Pizarro persuaded to
accompany him, and he left one of his own company,
who was fair of complexion and wore a long beard, to
learn the language of the Indians, so that he could act
as an interpreter upon his return. He also took several
of the native sheep, or llamas&mdash;“the little camels”&mdash;to
exhibit to those who would doubt his story at
Panama, or in Spain, for he had decided if necessary to
seek assistance from the King.</p>

<p>The natives received these fair-skinned navigators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with kindness and much curiosity, for the armor, guns,
and horses of these so-called “Children of the Sun”
greatly interested the gentle Peruvians. Several of the
Spaniards penetrated into the interior, and came back
with wondrous tales of temples filled with gold and
silver ornaments. So Pizarro was determined, upon
his return to Panama, to gather a force sufficient to
conquer the entire country, for his desire for wealth and
the power which this brings, was quite similar to that
of those who penetrate the arid wastes of Nevada, at
the present day, or search for the precious metal amidst
the hemlock-forests of Alaska.</p>

<p>Now, satisfied that a rich and populous kingdom lay
before him, Pizarro turned about and sailed northward,
and, after an absence of a year and a half, once more
talked with the irate Governor of Panama. As he was
supposed to have perished with all his men, the representative
of the Spanish King was quite considerate in
his treatment of him; but, when Pizarro asked for
further assistance in his scheme for the conquest of
Peru, the Governor seemed to have other use for his
money and his soldiers.</p>

<p>“What do I care?” cried the adventurer, in some
heat. “I can visit the King of Spain and he will
help me, I know. I am determined to succeed.”</p>

<p>This man, you see, had the power of will. Although
he had suffered hardship, mental anguish, famine; he
was certain that he could become master of the gentle
Peruvians, and so was determined to crush any obstacles
which came in his path and obstructed this ambition.
So far, his conduct had been noble, his treatment of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
friends and companions had been just, his own cheerfulness
and self control had been commendable. Let
us see how he conducted himself, when he had secured
that for which he sought?</p>

<p>Taking passage for Spain, he appeared at the Spanish
Court with two or three llamas, several natives, and
specimens of the woolen cloth and gold and silver ornaments
of the Peruvians, to bear witness to his tales of
this wonderful country. The King lent a ready ear to
his request for assistance; he was empowered to conquer
and take possession of Peru in the name of Spain;
and was requested to transport many priests along with
him, in order to convert the Indians to the Roman
Catholic religion. The ignorant swine-herd, in fact,
had become a man of some merit and mark, which so
greatly pleased his four half-brothers&mdash;who possessed
the high-sounding names of Hernando, Gonzalo, Juan,
and Francisco de Alcantara&mdash;that they all desired to
follow him to this land of the llama and the snow-capped
mountains.</p>

<p>“Hurray for brother Francisco,” said they. “He
will make us all rich! Hurray and God be with
him!”</p>

<p>Finally, two hundred and fifty men were gathered
for the conquest of Peru. The Pizarros set sail for
Panama&mdash;it was a family party now&mdash;and soon all
were again upon the shores of the New World. Three
ships were speedily loaded with equipment and provisions,
and, with one hundred and eighty followers
and twenty-seven horses, the Spanish free-booters and
adventurers sailed for the Bay of St. Matthew. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
landed, and immediately started operations in the usual
high-handed and brutal manner of the Spanish conqueror.</p>

<p>The little band of cut-throats went ashore and advanced
along the coast, while the three ships drifted
along in a parallel line, keeping as close inshore as discretion
would permit. When the Castilians reached a
town of some importance, they would rush in upon the
inhabitants, sword in hand, and would cut down all
who opposed them. The poor, frightened natives
would run away tumultuously, while the Pizarro
brothers, and other Castilian robbers, would collect all
the gold and silver ornaments that they could find.
Many emeralds were also secured, which were sent to
the ships, and back to Panama, in order to impress those
who were left behind with the fact that the army was
really accomplishing something. It was also done for
the effect that it would produce upon the irate and unaccommodating
Governor.</p>

<p>The Spaniards suffered greatly from the heat, for the
sun beat upon their iron breastplates and quilted cotton
doublets with most uncomfortable fury. In spite
of this, they kept on, and, as they advanced, the natives
fled before them.</p>

<p>They spent the rainy season upon an island; but,
when the weather grew clear again, being reënforced by
a hundred volunteers from Panama and more horses,
they again crossed to the mainland and resumed their
former operations.</p>

<p>They advanced to the town of Tumbez, expecting to
find a rich and populous city; but, greatly to their surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
they saw that this Peruvian stronghold had been
burned and abandoned, owing to a recent disagreement
between the inhabitants and the followers of the Inca.
This ruler, Atahuallpa Capac, had fallen out with his
brother, Huascar, and had advanced into his country
in order to humiliate him and to become master of all
Peru. Pizarro immediately made up his mind to
march and capture the Inca Atahuallpa, himself, and
to seize all of Peru for the Crown of Spain.</p>

<p>Some years before, the country had been conquered
by a native soldier and statesman, named Huayna
Capac, who left three sons: Huascar, the heir, and son
of the Queen; Manco Capac, a half-brother; and Atahuallpa,
a son of the Princess Quito. At the death of
Huayna Capac, the kingdom was divided into two parts;
Huascar succeeding to the empire of Peru, Atahuallpa
to the empire of Quito. The latter was of a warlike
disposition; the former was gentle and retiring. They
thus did not long remain at peace with one another, for,
Atahuallpa coveted the land of his brother, advanced
to take it, and, after a great battle, in which he was
victorious, overran, with his adherents, all the territory
of his rival. This had all happened only a short
time before Pizarro had landed, and the ruins of
Tumbez bore full witness to the ruthlessness of the
Inca’s wrath.</p>

<p>The conqueror, it was said, was but twelve days’ journey
inland, so the Castilians struck boldly into the
country, where they were everywhere received with
hospitality by the natives. The invaders were now
careful to give no offense, for they were very few and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were surrounded by many thousands, who could quickly
annihilate them, should they so wish.</p>

<p>An Indian gave Pizarro a scroll, as they advanced,
upon which had been written: “Know, whoever you
may be, that may chance to set foot in this country,
that it contains more silver and gold than there is iron
in Biscay.” This was shown to the soldiers, but they
laughed good-humoredly at it, believing that it was only
a device of their leader to give them confidence and
hope.</p>

<p>Pizarro halted his men, after five days of marching,
and told them that the expedition was to be a hazardous
one and that those who wished to retire could do so.
Nine of the soldiers availed themselves of this opportunity
to turn away from what lay in front, and, thus
rid of what would undoubtedly be a dangerous element,
the daring explorer pressed onward. He reached the
foot of the great mountains which tower above the
plains of Peru, and, sending forward a cavalier to speak
with Atahuallpa, received word from this native ruler
that he would be delighted to entertain the Spaniards
at his camp in the mountains.</p>

<p>The little army now toiled up the steep slopes of the
Cordilleras and came to many fortresses of stone which
overhung their path, and where a mere handful of men,
with little difficulty, could have barred their way. All
was quiet and deserted, for luck was with this adventurer,
and finally his band of treasure-seekers reached
the summit of the mountains. An Indian messenger
appeared from the Inca, who requested that he be informed
when the Spaniards would reach Caxamalca,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
where they were to be entertained by the proud and
imperious Atahuallpa. The messenger spoke glowingly
of the might of his master; but Pizarro assured
him that the King of Spain was the mightiest
monarch under the sun, and that his servants would
convince the Inca that they bore nothing but messages
of good will from their master in far distant
Castile.</p>

<p>The Spaniards marched onward for two days, then
began to descend the eastern side of the Cordilleras,
where they met a second envoy from the Inca. Seven
days later the valley of Caxamalca lay before them, and,
to the startled eyes of these adventurers, came the
vision of several miles of white tents: those of the
Inca’s followers. Pizarro put on a bold front, marched
towards the encampment, and, sending forward a cavalier
with thirty-five horsemen to the Inca’s pavilion, entered
the outskirts of the town of Caxamalca. The
Peruvian nobility was in the courtyard, so, tramping
onward, the Spanish adventurers passed through a long
line of nobles to where Atahuallpa himself sat upon a
low stool, distinguished by a crimson ribbon bound
around his forehead, which he had placed there after
the defeat of his brother, Huascar.</p>

<p>Pizarro rode up to the monarch of the Peruvian
wilds, and, bowing in a lowly and respectful manner,
informed him that he was the subject of the mighty
Prince across the ocean, and that, attracted by the
report of the warlike prowess of the Inca, he had come
to offer him his services and those of his men, and to
impart to him the doctrines of true faith, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
professed. He also invited Atahuallpa to visit him in
his own encampment.</p>

<p>The Inca seemed to be dazed, and listened with his
eyes fixed upon the ground. One of his nobles then
said: “It is well.”</p>

<p>“Can you not speak for yourself,” asked Pizarro,
turning to the Inca, “and tell me what is your desire?”</p>

<p>At this the proud native smiled faintly, and replied,
through an interpreter:</p>

<p>“I am keeping a fast which will end to-morrow morning.
I will then visit you. In the meantime, pray
occupy the public buildings on the square and no other,
until I order what shall be done.”</p>

<p>Pizarro bowed. At that moment one of his soldiers,
who was mounted upon a fiery steed, touched it
with his spurs and galloped away. Whirling around,
he dashed back through the crowd of natives and drew
rein before the immobile Atahuallpa, who never, for
an instant, lost his composure. Several of his soldiers,
however, shrank back in manifest terror as this strange
creature passed by, for such a wonderful animal had
never been seen before in this country. The Spaniards
now left, and, after they had departed, all of those who
had shown fear of the galloping horse in the presence of
the strangers, were put to death by order of the Inca.</p>

<p>That night Pizarro perfected his plan for the capture
of Atahuallpa. He saw that, should he give battle to
the Inca in the open field, it would doubtless end in
disastrous defeat for the Spaniards, as the natives far
out-numbered this handful of Castilians. His only
chance for victory seemed to be to capture the Inca, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hold him prisoner, and to intimidate the vast horde of
natives, by threat of death to their ruler, if they attacked
the Spanish invaders. He therefore determined
to entice the native to the building in which he and his
men were lodged, which was built upon a square courtyard.
His soldiers were to remain hidden around the
central court, and, when Atahuallpa and his retainers
should be in the very middle of the square, the Spaniards
were to rush in upon him, and, putting the Peruvians
to the sword, were to seize the unfortunate native
ruler and hold him fast. This was the bold conception
of this heartless adventurer, a veritable dare-devil,
whose conscience was free from the lofty and proper
conceptions of brotherly love.</p>

<p>The night was a quiet one. The Spaniards made a
careful inspection of their arms and equipment, loaded
all their guns, and stationed themselves at the places
designated by their artful leader. At dawn they were
ready, but it was late in the day before the Inca
approached. He was preceded by a native courier,
who informed Pizarro that his master was coming
armed, even as the Spaniards had come to him.</p>

<p>“Tell your master,” said the Castilian, “that come
as he may, I will receive him as a friend and a brother.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the procession approached.
First came a large number of natives, who had brooms
in their hands and who swept all rubbish from the
roadway. Then came a crowd of Peruvian soldiers.
In their center the Inca was carried aloft upon a litter,
surrounded by his nobles, who wore quantities of golden
ornaments which glittered and gleamed in the sunshine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
The Peruvian army followed, and, when they had all
arrived within half a mile of the gate to the city,
Pizarro was startled to see them halt. They seemed to
be preparing to encamp, and a runner came to the courtyard,
stating that the Inca had decided to delay his
entrance into the city until the following morning.</p>

<p>“Tell your master,” said Pizarro, “that I have provided
a feast for his entertainment, and that my followers
will be grievously disappointed if he does not
come to visit us this day.”</p>

<p>The runner went away, and Pizarro beat his foot
upon the floor in anxious solicitude, for, should the Inca
not come at this time, he feared that he would not be
able to control his own followers, who had been under
arms since daylight.</p>

<p>To the delight of the Spanish, a second runner now
approached, who announced that the Inca would meet
the white men; but would bring into the town with
him only a few unarmed warriors. Pizarro breathed
easier, and then inspected his followers, finding that all
were in their places and eager for the attack.</p>

<p>The day was wearing to a close. Deep shadows from
the gabled ends of the ancient buildings fell upon the
courtyard, as the Peruvians, chanting their songs of
triumph, entered the city gate and unsuspectingly
marched onward to their destruction. Atahuallpa was
in an open litter, lined with the brilliantly colored
plumes of tropical birds and studded with burnished
plates of gold and of silver. Around his neck hung a
collar of large and brilliant emeralds. His dress was
of the richest silk. At this time he was about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
years of age and had a fine frame, a large and handsome
head; but bloodshot eyes, which gave him a fierce
and vindictive appearance. His bearing was calm, yet
dignified, and he gazed upon the natives about him as
one accustomed to command. He was surrounded by
nobles, who were clad in blue uniforms studded with
gold.</p>

<p>The procession entered the great square of the house
which had been assigned to the Spaniard, but not a
Castilian soldier was there. Only a priest, Father Valverde,
Pizarro’s Chaplain, was to be seen. He came
forward, bible in hand, and, walking to the Inca’s litter,
began to explain to him the doctrines of the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>“The Pope at Rome has commissioned the Emperor
of Spain to conquer and to convert the inhabitants of
this western world,” said he to the Inca, “and I beseech
you, therefore, to embrace the Christian faith and
acknowledge yourself a tributary to the Emperor
Charles of Spain, who will aid and protect you as a
loyal vassal.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, fire flashed from the eyes of Atahuallpa,
and he answered: “I will be no man’s tributary. I
am far greater than any Prince on earth. Your own
Emperor may be a great prince, I do not doubt it when
I see that he has sent his subjects so far across the
waters, and I am willing to hold him as a brother. As
for the Pope of whom you speak, he must certainly be
insane to give away countries which do not belong to
him. As for my faith, I will not change it. Your
own God, you say, was put to death by the very men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
whom he trusted, but mine”&mdash;here he stretched out
his hand towards the setting sun&mdash;“my God still
lives in the heavens and looks down upon his children.
By what authority, man of Spain, do you say these
things?”</p>

<p>The friar pointed to the well-worn bible which he
held in his hand.</p>

<p>The Inca took it, looked at it for an instant, and
then threw it violently down, exclaiming: “Tell your
comrades that they shall give an account of their doings
in my land. I will not go from here until they
have given me full satisfaction for all the wrongs which
they have committed.”</p>

<p>This startled Valverde, and, rushing to Pizarro, he
cried out:</p>

<p>“Do you not see that, while we stand here wasting
our breath in talking with this dog&mdash;full of pride as
he is&mdash;the fields behind him are filling up with his
Indian allies? Set upon him at once, I absolve
you.”</p>

<p>Pizarro smiled, for he saw that the moment to strike
had arrived. So he waved a white scarf, a gun was
fired as a signal for the attack, and from every opening,
the Spaniards poured into the great square, sword in
hand, shouting their old battle-cry: “St. Iago and at
them!”</p>

<p>A few cannon, which they had dragged up the mountain
slopes with much stress and difficulty, were turned
upon the startled Peruvians, and were discharged.
The Indians were unarmed and were taken totally by
surprise. Stunned by the noise of the artillery and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
blinded with smoke, they rushed hither and thither in
confusion, as the Spanish free-booters pressed in upon
every side.</p>

<p>Fierce and agonizing cries went up from the courtyard,
as nobles and Peruvian soldiers were ruthlessly
cut down and trampled under the feet of the Spanish
horsemen. So great, indeed, was the impact of these
writhing Indians when they were pressed back against
the wall of clay and stone, which surrounded the courtyard,
that they broke through it, and, clambering over
the débris, rushed headlong into the open country, hotly
pursued in every direction by the Castilian cavalrymen,
who cut them down with their sharp broadswords.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of the Inca, for the possession of
whose body the invaders were making such a desperate
effort?</p>

<p>Atahuallpa sat as if stunned. His litter was forced
this way and that by the swaying throng, while his native
attendants faithfully endeavored to defend him.
As fast as one was cut down, another took his place,
and, with their dying grasp, they clung to the bridles
of the cavaliers in a vain endeavor to keep them away
from the body of their sacred master. Fearing that
the Inca might escape in the darkness, a few cavaliers
now dashed in, in an attempt to end the battle by taking
the life of the Peruvian chieftain; but Pizarro saw
this action, and cried out: “Let no man who values
his life strike at the Inca!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stretched out his arm in order to
shield him, and received a wound in the hand from one
of his own men. This, strange to relate, is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the only wound received by any Spaniard during the
entire action.</p>

<p>The litter was now overturned, and Atahuallpa
would have fallen violently to the ground, had not Pizarro
and two of his soldiers caught the now humiliated
chieftain in their arms. A soldier immediately
snatched the crimson ribbon from his forehead. The
helpless Peruvian monarch was taken to the nearest
building and was carefully guarded, while his followers
ceased their fruitless struggle and ran away as fast as
they were able. The Castilian horsemen pursued
them, until night fell, and the sound of the trumpet recalled
them to the square at Caxamalca. It is recorded
that many thousand of the Indians lay dead about the
city, while not a single Spaniard had forfeited his life
in this sharp but important engagement.</p>

<p>The Spaniards now had the Inca in their possession;
but they were very few, in a great country, and surrounded
by enemies. Atahuallpa seemed to be resigned
to his unfortunate position; but he was determined
to gain his freedom, if possible. He saw that
gold was what his captors chiefly desired, and decided
to try to buy his freedom, for he feared that Huascar
might wrest the kingdom from him when he discovered
that his brother was in captivity. He therefore promised
Pizarro that he would fill the room in which they
stood with gold, if he would but set him free.</p>

<p>“I will stuff with gold this chamber in which we
stand,” said he. “Not only will I cover the floor with
it, but I will pile it up to a line drawn around the walls
as high as you can reach.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Pizarro was dumb-founded, for the room was seventeen
feet broad by twenty-two feet long, and the line
upon the wall was nine feet high. He was still more
affected when the Inca agreed to fill a smaller room, adjoining
this one, with silver twice over, if he were given
two months’ time.</p>

<p>The Spaniard decided to accept, for, should Atahuallpa
really do this, he could even then make way with
him and still have possession of the gold.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” he remarked. “When you have fulfilled
your contract, you shall have your freedom.”</p>

<p>Alas for the Inca! He did not know that treachery
was the chief trait of all these Spanish adventurers.</p>

<p>The collection of the treasure went rapidly on, while
Atahuallpa remained in the Spanish quarters, treated
with great consideration, but strictly guarded. He
even learned to play chess, and, although closely
watched, was allowed to see his subjects freely. His
dress was sometimes of vicuña wool, sometimes of bats’
skins which were velvety sleek. He changed this often,
but nothing which he had worn could be used by
another, and, when he laid a robe aside, it was
burned.</p>

<p>Huascar, meanwhile, had heard of Atahuallpa’s capture
and this roused in him a hope that he could regain
his own kingdom, of which he had been recently despoiled.
He sent word, therefore, to Pizarro, that,
should the Spaniards wish it, he could pay a far
greater ransom than his brother. He would expect to
be reinstated to the chief command after this had
been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>News of this came to Atahuallpa, who also learned
that Pizarro had said that Huascar should be brought
to Caxamalca, so that he, himself, might determine
which of the two brothers had a better right to the
scepter of the Incas. This aroused in him a furious
jealousy, and, fearing that the claims of his brother
might be respected, he ordered secretly that Huascar
should be put to death by his guards as he approached.
He was accordingly drowned in the river Andamapa,
as he neared Caxamalca.</p>

<p>“The white men will avenge my murder,” said he,
with his dying breath, “and my brother will find that
he will not long survive my assassination!”</p>

<p>He was quite correct in this surmise, for the Spaniards
grew suspicious of the Inca, and pretended to believe
that he was arranging a general uprising among
the Peruvians against the white men. When the treasure
had nearly all been collected, they demanded that
Pizarro should disburse it among them, which was done,
after the golden vases and ornaments had been melted
down into solid bars. What do you think? It was
worth nearly three and a half million pounds sterling,
or seventeen million five hundred thousand dollars
($17,500,000.00).</p>

<p>This distribution practically ruined the soldiers.
They squandered it recklessly, or lost it over dice and
cards. Very few were wise enough to return to Spain
in order to enjoy their ill-gotten spoils in their native
country, and one, indeed, lost a portion of one of the
great golden images of the Sun, taken from the chief
temple, in a single night of gaming; whence came the
famous Spanish proverb: “He plays away the sun before
sunrise!”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The wild and reckless Castilians, drunk with gold and
sudden power, clamored for the life of the unhappy
Inca, for rumors reached them that an immense army
was mustering at Quito to attack them. Atahuallpa
denied any knowledge of this, but his protestations of
innocence did him little good. Pizarro, taking advantage
of the absence of some of the cavaliers who would
have defended the poor, helpless Indian, ordered him to
be brought to instant trial. Several brown-skinned witnesses
were produced, who gave testimony which sealed
his doom; and, in spite of the fact that a few of the
Spaniards staunchly stood up for him, he was found
guilty of having assassinated his brother Huascar, of
raising an insurrection against the invaders, and was
sentenced to be burned alive.</p>

<p>The miserable Inca, when informed of his impending
fate, lost, for a moment, his courage, which had
heretofore never deserted him.</p>

<p>“What have I or my children done,” said he to
Pizarro, “that I should meet such a doom? And,
from your hands, too! You who have met with nothing
but friendship and kindness from my people, and
who have received nothing but benefits from my
hands.”</p>

<p>In piteous wails he begged for his life.</p>

<p>“I promise to pay double the ransom already given
you, if you will but spare me,” said he.</p>

<p>It was all of no avail. After he had consented
to give up his own religion and be baptized, he was executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as the Spaniards were accustomed to put all
their prisoners to death,&mdash;by strangulation.</p>

<p>Pizarro had no easy time after this. Although Almagro
had arrived with reënforcements, there was
serious trouble with all the Indians in the country.
Freed of the power which governed them, they broke
into fierce excesses, the remote provinces threw off their
allegiance to the Incas, the great captains of distant
armies set up for themselves, gold and silver acquired
a new importance in their eyes; it was eagerly seized
and hidden in caves and in forests. All Peru was in
an uproar.</p>

<p>Thus it remained for many years until, at last, the
Spaniards successfully defeated all the native forces
and secured the country to their own dominion. But
now they began to fight among themselves for the
possession of the fruitful land. Almagro lived to be
seventy years of age, after a life of continual battle
and adventure. Finally he was put to death by Hernando
Pizarro, the brother of Francisco, who had followed
him here from Spain. The murderer also dispatched
his son, but he himself was imprisoned in
Madrid for these acts. He lived for many years after
his release, some say to be a hundred. Francisco’s
other brother, Gonzalo, was beheaded in Peru for rebelling
against the Spanish emperor.</p>

<p>As for Francisco, that swine-herd who had conquered
the fair land of Peru and had let no obstacle stand in
the way of his chosen purpose, he, himself, came to no
peaceful end. Brutal, remorseless, ambitious, greedy,
it was only natural, that, when he had acquired power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
he should stir up enemies even among his own people.
In the lovely month of June, 1541, he was murdered
in his own house at Lima by the desperate followers of
the young Almagro, or the “Men of Chili,” as they
called themselves. Secretly and hastily he was buried
by a few faithful servants in an obscure corner of the
cathedral, and thus miserably ended the life of this
man of adventurous spirit and desperate courage.</p>

<p>One cannot but admire the will-power of this Castilian,
his serene calmness in time of danger, and his indifference
to physical suffering. But his ruthlessness
and cruelty to the Inca, his vindictive lust for riches,
his lack of feeling for the inoffensive natives, can give
him no such position in the Hall of Fame as is held by
a Lincoln, a Gordon, or a George Washington.</p>

<p>Peace to your restless and ambitious soul, Francisco
Pizarro!</p>

<h2 class="p4">HERNANDO DE SOTO:</h2>

<p class="pch">DISCOVERER OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1496-1542)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the old Spanish town of Seville, at the time when
Pizarro and his numerous brothers were conquering
the gentle Peruvians, the streets were often
filled with the adventurers who had returned from
Mexico, Panama, and South America, laden with the
treasures of plundered cities. Among these successful
cavaliers, no one had a more gallant bearing, or a more
captivating presence, than Hernando de Soto, who had
been with the Castilian troops in their battles upon the
lofty Peruvian plains.</p>

<p>When the rapacious Spaniards had divided the ransom
of the helpless Atahuallpa, which amounted to such
a fabulous sum, the ambitious De Soto’s share, it is
said, was fully a million dollars of our own money.
You see, therefore, that, when he returned to Spain,
he could set up a princely establishment and was one
of the most important citizens of the country. But,
dissatisfied with the humdrum life of the civilized community
in which he had hoped to end his days, he
longed to go once more to this New World and discover
other cities and other mines of treasure. He therefore
asked the King to allow him to undertake an expedition
at his own expense, for he was so rich in worldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
goods that he had no need of financial assistance from
the throne, which all the other discoverers and explorers
has been seriously in need of. None, in fact, could
have succeeded in their hazardous enterprises without
the aid of the Castilian gold.</p>

<p>Romance is a vast assistance to exploration. Men
look towards the unknown, wonder what is there, and,
in order to verify their conjectures, go and explore.
They bring back many stories. This element was of
great aid to the daring Cavalier, for a fanciful legend
was then current in Spain to the effect, that, in that far-distant
America, was a country so rich in gold, that its
King was completely gilded. He was known as El
Dorado, the gilded man, and it became generally believed
that this Kingdom of the Gilded Man lay somewhere in
that vast, unexplored region, then called Florida.</p>

<p>The King of Spain appointed De Soto Governor of
this fabled country, and decreed that he should have the
power to subdue and to rule it. When it became known
that the famous cavalier was about to start for the
New World, recruits flocked to his standard, and both
high and low-born vied with each other to gain a place
in his company of explorers. Men of noble birth even
sold their estates in order to properly equip themselves
for this expedition, as they expected to duplicate the
experiences of the cavaliers in Peru and in Mexico.
Many a tradesman, also, parted with his little shop in
order to purchase armor, guns, and supplies for the
great undertaking. The conquest of Florida was the
talk of the hour and was upon every lip. It was a
popular enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>One beautifully clear morning in Spring a fleet of
white-winged galleons swept from the harbor of Seville.
Crowds lined the quays, and, although a faint cheer or
two was heard, there were many gloomy faces, for there
was a multitude of disappointed aspirants who could
not find a vacant place upon the overcrowded ships.
Bugles blared a parting salute, the yellow flag of Spain
was dipped into the blue Atlantic, and with cries of
“Adios! We will find El Dorado!” the cheering followers
of this swashbuckling hero of that day, gazed
eagerly towards the now well-known passage to the
Spanish Main. It was more like a monster picnic
party than a serious expedition.</p>

<p>The Spaniards landed at Cuba, where they delayed
for nearly a year, and passed their time in a round
of balls, tilting-matches and bullfights. After having
enjoyed themselves to the full, they again embarked
and headed for Florida, landing upon the beach at
Tampa, where the American troops who were to wrest
Cuba from the Spanish rule, set out for the harbor of
Santiago, in the summer of 1898. All were cheerful
and happy, eagerly looking forward to the not far distant
time when they would find rich and populous cities
to be sacked and looted in the same manner that they
had despoiled the Peruvian and Mexican strongholds.</p>

<p>Fearing no enemy, about three hundred of them went
ashore and encamped near the beach. They christened
the bay, The Bay of the Holy Spirit; and yet they
were to find no Holy Spirit nestling behind the solemn
palm trees which grew almost down to the sand, for, as
they lay in fanciful security, suddenly the thicket rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with the wild war-whoops of the native Floridians, and
a horde of dusky forms rushed in among them, shooting
arrows and striking with sharp, stone tomahawks.</p>

<p>All was now a scene of terror and confusion. A few
of the Spaniards ran to the water’s edge, shrilly blowing
upon their trumpets in order to attract those left
upon the ships. Others cried loudly for help, and, piling
into the longboats, their comrades hastened to their
assistance, leaped upon the sand, and, with a fierce
battle-cry, drove the Indians pell-mell into the sheltering
palms. Thereafter the Castilians were most careful
to establish a picket-post around their encampments,
for they had suffered severely in this first encounter.</p>

<p>The boats were now unloaded, many of the larger vessels
were sent back to Cuba, while the smaller craft, or
caravels, were kept for the service of the army. A
number of men were left on guard at Tampa, while the
remainder set off into the forest, heading towards the
northeast. They had not gone far before they came
upon a white man, who was none other than a lonely
survivor of a previous expedition, led by a Spaniard
called Narváez. His name was Juan Ortiz. He had
been with the Indians for a long time, as he had been
very young when captured by the natives. They had
spared his life because of the intercession of a chief’s
daughter. Since this lucky proceeding, which was
quite similar to that of Pocohontas and John Rolfe, he
had lived with a neighboring tribe. The Spaniards
were delighted to secure his services as a guide and interpreter.</p>

<p>When the followers of Pizarro had reached Peru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
they had immediately found gold among the natives.
You know that this is what they were after and what
they seized upon with greedy fingers. Not so in palm-studded
Florida. For, as the mail-clad invaders pushed
into this barren and sandy country, they found no gold
and no splendid cities with temples filled with jeweled
images. After marching for hours through interminable
pine forests and floundering through dense swamps,
where the natives shot at them with poisoned arrows
from behind trees, and harassed and slew them as they
splashed through the mire and deep water, they found
nothing but deserted villages and a few aged Indians
who were too decrepit to make their escape.</p>

<p>This naturally angered the adventurers. Those who
had sold their property in order to join in this hazardous
expedition, began to be sorry that they had ever left
the peaceful soil of old Castile. Those who had sacrificed
good positions to take a chance in the search of
this El Dorado, began to bewail their coming, and
to bemoan the fact that they had listened to the sweet
strains of romance which had been woven over these
expeditions into the unknown.</p>

<p>The fabled El Dorado could be no gilded chieftain,
he was a gilded fool. Alas that they ever left the gray
cobbled streets of ancient Seville!</p>

<p>Yet on, on, they toiled wearily, ever hoping to find
the gold which never came to view. They finally approached
a native village which was filled with warriors
of mettle, for they were furiously attacked. A
shower of arrows fell among them, but, little heeding
these missiles, the Spaniards discharged their guns, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
rushing upon the patriotic Indians, easily routed them.
Many of the poor redskins took refuge in a pond and
swam out so that they could not be reached. The Spaniards
immediately surrounded the water and awaited
developments. A historian of the period says:</p>

<p>“Nine hundred Indians took to the pond, and, all
day long, continued to swim around shouting defiance
and mounting on each other’s shoulders in order to shoot
their arrows. Night came, and not one had surrendered;
midnight, and still not one. At ten o’clock the
next day, after twenty-four hours in the water, some
two hundred came out, all stiff and cold. Others followed.
The last seven would not give up, but were
dragged out unconscious by the Spaniards, who swam
in after them, when they had been thirty hours in the
water, without touching bottom. Then the humane invaders
exerted themselves to warm and restore to life
these unfortunate people.”</p>

<p>In spite of this kind treatment, the men from Castile
put irons on many of these natives, and took them
along with them, so that they would have slaves to
transport their baggage, pound their corn, and serve
them when in camp. A soldier, who has written of this
journey, says that, upon one occasion, the enslaved prisoners
rose against their masters and tried to massacre
them, but the Spaniards crushed this attempt, brought
the helpless Indians to the village square, and caused
them to be hacked to pieces by their halberdiers, or
swordsmen. You can readily see that these invaders
were making no happy impression upon simple-minded
Americans.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards were now in the country of Apalachee,
which was then, as it is to-day, a land of agriculture,
with well-tilled fields of corn, of pumpkins and beans,
and with a farm-loving population of red men. The
Castilians seized all the provisions which they needed
for their journey, and, when the Indians objected, slew
them mercilessly, but not without the loss of many of
their own people.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the party were much dissatisfied
with the fact that they had not discovered gold,
De Soto seemed to be satisfied with the outlook. A few
men were sent to the south in order to find the ocean,
and came back with the report that they had run upon
a magnificent harbor: the Bay of Pensacola. They had
also seen the skulls of horses on the beach, these being
the remains of those killed by the Spanish explorer,
Narváez, who had fed the flesh to his men while engaged
in building boats for their departure from this country.
De Soto ordered a vessel to set sail for Cuba, stating
that he had met with great success, was much pleased
with the outlook, and wished more men and horses.</p>

<p>This was all very well for the provisional Governor,
but still no gold had been found, and the soldiers were
discouraged and disgusted with this lack of success.
Eagerly they listened to the tales of two Indian boys
who undertook to guide them to a region where they
would find gold in abundance; the land of the Cofachiqui.
It was towards the northeast, said the lads, so the
Spaniards set out in that direction, expecting to find a
city similar to Tumbez in Peru, and also El Dorado,
the golden man, sitting upon a throne of solid golden ingots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Accordingly, they set out to cross the territory
which is now the State of Georgia. It was a pleasant,
fruitful land, inhabited by a peaceable and kindly people,
who entertained them hospitably in their villages,
and furnished them generously with food. The Spaniards
had no need of resorting to their usual cruel
methods, and the chiefs gave them guides and porters
so that they could more easily pass on.</p>

<p>But see how crafty and keen these old Indians were!</p>

<p>A certain chieftain offered to furnish the travelers
with guides and with porters. The Castilians eagerly
accepted the offer, but so many armed warriors assembled
in order to go with them, that the Spaniards
suspected them of meditating treachery, and thus
watched them very closely. The Indians seemed to
travel along peacefully enough; but, when the village
of Cofachiqui was reached, and the Spanish soldiers
had gone to sleep, their redskinned guides and porters
fell upon the unsuspecting natives, who lived there, and
massacred all upon whom they could lay their hands.
This, indeed, had been a war-party in disguise, which
had taken a clever method of invading the territory of
a tribe which was hostile to them, and which heretofore
they had been afraid to attack. The affair took place
at a distance of between thirty or forty miles below the
present city of Augusta, Georgia.</p>

<p>Still the travelers kept on and on. Ever were their
thoughts upon gold, and yet no gold seemed to appear,
nor did the natives seem to possess any of the precious
metal. After they had crossed a broad river, they found
a well-to-do race of natives in a well-tilled country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
governed by a young woman who received them with
great kindness and gave them corn, pork, and sweet
potatoes. She also presented them with pearls, of
which she had a great quantity, as they were found in
the shell-fish in the streams. De Soto saw little value
in these stones, and, although he was invited to carry
away all that he could, he refused to take more than
fifty pounds, as a sample to show to the Cubans when
he should return. He was also presented with a herd
of hogs, which he drove off before him towards the west.</p>

<p>The climate was not unhealthy, and so the Castilians
had an easy time of it. They wandered through upper
Georgia, across the mountains into lower Tennessee,
and then into the present State of Alabama. As vessels
from Cuba were expected to meet them with re-enforcements
and supplies, they now headed for Pensacola
Bay.</p>

<p>At a place called Choctaw Bluff, not far from the
present city of Mobile, they came to an Indian town
presided over by a fierce chieftain by the name of
Tuscaloosa, which means Black Warrior. This village
had the sweet-sounding name of Mauvila. It was surrounded
by a high palisade, which was chinked and plastered
with mud, and, besides this, there were slits in
the sides of the walls, so that those who defended it
could shoot through at an attacking party.</p>

<p>De Soto rode ahead of the main body of Castilians
with about a hundred horsemen. They were clad in
doublets and trousers, with steel caps, breast plates and
greaves upon their legs. As it was warm, most of this
armor was slung to their saddles with cords, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
cavaliers trotted along joyously, chanting many an old
Spanish song, and laughing and jesting with one another,
for they were having a pleasant journey, even
though no gold had been discovered. Reaching the
sleepy little village of these southern Indians, they were
met by the chief, Tuscaloosa, who appeared to be most
friendly and asked them to enter and have a feast.
Fearing nothing, and remembering the pleasant reception
which they had received while marching through
Georgia, they trotted gayly forward, while De Soto
chatted with the chief by means of a native interpreter.</p>

<p>They rode to a position near the palisade, and then,
dismounting, went inside in order to greet the inhabitants.
Here was a large Indian town and hundreds
of women, who greeted them in a friendly manner and
waved their hands. Almost immediately a blow was
struck. The Spaniards say that they were enticed into
the palisade on purpose, and in order that they might
be slaughtered by thousands of warriors who were hidden
behind the wigwams, and had been summoned
thither from the surrounding country. This is hardly
probable, for, had the Indians contemplated a battle,
they would certainly have first removed their children.
No doubt a hot-headed Castilian started all the trouble.
At any rate the soldiers from Seville were soon engaged
in a fierce hand-to-hand encounter with a vast concourse
of howling savages.</p>

<p>There was a fearful battle. The cavaliers had fortunately
donned their armor, after dismounting from
their horses, and it was well, for a shower of sharp-pointed
arrows fell amongst them. A horde of Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
swarmed from their houses and swept the invaders before
them, driving them in a struggling mass through
the narrow entrance to the palisade. The Castilians
ran to their horses and hastily mounted, but some were
so hard-pressed by the natives that they were unable
to get into their saddles, while their patient steeds,
struck with a shower of arrows, broke away and ran
frantically into the woods. In spite of the confusion
and uproar, the Spaniards kept cool, and, although
driven to a distance, formed a battle line and came
back, pressing the native bowmen before them. With
fixed lances they charged into the yelping mob, only
to be met with splendid courage by the native soldiers.</p>

<p>De Soto bore himself right valiantly and led his men,
using his long, sharp lance with deadly effect. His
soldiers, too, were not laggards in the attack, and followed
him closely, shouting the Spanish battle cry:
“St. Iago and at them!” Many were sorely wounded.
De Soto himself, as he leaned forward to make a lance
thrust, received an arrow in the exposed portion of his
thigh. This made it impossible for him to sit down, so,
throughout the remainder of the day, he rode, standing
in his stirrups.</p>

<p>Several of the more prominent Castilians were shot
dead. The Spanish leader’s brother, Diego de Soto,
was pierced through the eye by an arrow, which came
out at the back of his neck. A young cavalier, called
Carlo Enriquez, who had married the Governor of Florida’s
niece, leaned over the neck of his horse in order
to pull out an arrow from the animal’s breast, and thus
exposed his throat, which was instantly pierced by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Indian barb, so that he fell prostrate. Thus the battle
raged furiously, while shrill trumpets blared out
the distress of the Spaniards and summoned their easy-riding
comrades to come speedily to their assistance.</p>

<p>The greater portion of De Soto’s troop were jogging
peacefully along in the sunshine, little realizing into
what a desperate strait their advance guard had fallen.
Late in the afternoon they approached the Indian village
and were much surprised to see dense volumes of
smoke rising to the sky. Those in advance sent back
word to hurry on, while they galloped forward in order
to see what was amiss. All hurried towards the sound
of battle, and, now, realizing that their comrades were
in a desperate fight, they rushed to their assistance,
cheering wildly as they did so. The black smoke was
pouring from the thatched Indian houses, which the
Spaniards had set on fire, and a bloody hand-to-hand engagement
was in progress around the smoking débris.
The main body of cavaliers had now arrived. They
charged vigorously, cutting down both women and men,
and, amidst the shrieks of the women and wailing of
little children, Tuscaloosa’s people were annihilated.
At last all had been dispersed or butchered.</p>

<p>The Spanish histories of this bloody affair say that
at last only a solitary warrior was left. Seeing that all
his friends and companions had either perished or fled,
he sprang upon the palisade, and, finding that he was
surrounded on all sides by vindictive steel-clad Spaniards
with menacing swords, he twisted off his bow-string,
and, making a slip-noose, hanged himself to
the stout limb of a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The battle of Mauvila had left De Soto in a sorry
state, for eighty-two of his followers had been killed,
and so many of the men had been wounded that the
surgeon could not give them proper attention. In fact,
so broken up were the cavaliers, and particularly the
horses, which had suffered badly from the numerous
arrows which had been fired into them, that De Soto
was forced to tarry in the vicinity of the ruined Indian
village for three weeks. The Spanish accounts of the
battle say that eleven thousand natives fell before the
swords, lances, and clumsy muskets of the Castilian
invaders of this peaceful country.</p>

<p>De Soto was only a few days’ journey from Pensacola,
where the ship, which he had sent to Cuba for
supplies, was to reach him. Yet, instead of heading
for the ocean, he decided to march towards the north,
evidently hoping to find some city where was gold and
silver, similar to that which he had seen in the table-lands
of Peru.</p>

<p>The El Dorado seekers accordingly marched northwest,
and passed through a flat country where was much
game. The Indians were treacherous and constantly
annoyed them by attempting to steal their horses, and
by attacking any parties which traveled at a distance
from the main column. It was now December. As the
weather grew chill, De Soto determined to spend the
winter in some convenient spot, and, as he now came
upon a well-built Indian town, which had recently been
deserted, he reached the conclusion that this was the
very place for which he had been in search. Accordingly,
his cavaliers made themselves comfortable in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
thatched huts of the Chickasaws, for such was the name
of the redskins who had settled here.</p>

<p>Trouble was still in store for the adventurous gold-seekers.</p>

<p>After their many battles and long journeys, the men
enjoyed themselves in hunting and in taking life easy.
There was an abundance of corn stored here, so their
horses grew sleek and fat, while their masters chased
rabbits and other small game. All was peaceful. Apparently
not an Indian was in the vicinity, so the guards
relaxed their vigilance, grew somewhat careless, and
unsuspectingly offered a tempting opening to any redskins
who might wish to attack them.</p>

<p>One night the Chickasaws made good use of their opportunity
to get even with the invaders of what they
considered to be their sacred soil. It was towards the
end of January and a fierce north wind was blowing.
While the men were sleeping in their huts, suddenly
a wild war-whoop welled upon the night air, and, as
the wind howled dismally, the roofs over their heads
burst into a crackling blaze. Fanned by the high
breeze, the flames leaped into the air, and, in a moment
the whole camp was red with fire. The Spaniards
sprang to arms and rushed forth to the fray, some in
their shirts, and many without their armor on.</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>Under cover of the darkness, and unheard, because
of the blustering wind, the vindictive Chickasaws had approached
their abandoned town and had furiously attacked
it. They had poured in a volley of arrows with
burning wisps attached to them, which quickly ignited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the thatched roofs and sent a reddening glare over the
scene of confusion. De Soto leaped upon his horse,
but did so hurriedly and without tightening the girth.
It turned with him and he pitched to the ground, falling
upon his chest. Immediately the howling savages
surrounded him and attempted to put an end to his life,
but his men rushed to his assistance, beat off the shrieking
Chickasaws, and dragged him by the feet to a position
of safety. Leaping again to the saddle, with a
mighty cheer, he led his men into the fray with such
impetuosity, that the Indians disappeared into the blackness.
Forty of the Spaniards had been killed, fifty of
their precious horses had been prostrated by barbed
arrows and flaming brands, while the larger part of
their clothing, arms, their saddles and their provisions,
had been consumed. They were also houseless, and the
wind was bitterly chill. Fortunately, the Chickasaws
did not again attack.</p>

<p>But the hostile savages did not leave them alone.
When Spring came and the horsemen resumed their
march, they were repeatedly harassed by the red men,
who crept near them on every side, and cut down any
unsuspecting Spaniard who wandered from the column.</p>

<p>Pursuing a northwesterly course, the cavaliers at
length came upon a great force of the natives, who,
stripped to their waists and painted with various colors,
yelled their defiance and brandished their spears
and arrows at the invaders. Nearby was their stronghold,
a palisade surrounding their huts, which had three
entrances. The Spaniards advanced in three columns
to attack these openings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>What could these half-clad redskins do against men
in steel armor, and with sword, buckler, and arquebusier?
The Castilians drove them into their fortification
like sheep, and there massacred them as they
had the fierce warriors under Tuscaloosa. According
to old accounts, two thousand of the Indians were slain,
although the native warriors inflicted quite a loss upon
their attackers. The invaders secured provisions, corn,
and female slaves, which they transported with them in
their journey towards the northwest.</p>

<p>The Spaniards took their battles lightly, for they considered
it all a part of the day’s work. They resumed
their march, but now they must have been pretty sure
that no El Dorado could exist in this flat and somewhat
marshy country. Still, they were cheerful, and
when, a few weeks later, they came upon a great muddy
river which was so wide that they could not see a man
upon the other bank, they felt that certainly their trip,
their many discomforts, and their losses, had not been
in vain. When they viewed the turbid current of the
Mississippi they were filled with silent awe, and a
priest, holding the cross of Christ high in the air,
blessed the surging flood, while De Soto cried out: “I
take you in behalf of the King of Spain, and shall call
you mine own from henceforth!”</p>

<p>This gallant cavalier was a man of resource. He set
his soldiers immediately to work constructing boats,
and, gradually moving up the river in order to find a
place where it would be possible to cross&mdash;for the little
army was upon high bluffs (now called the Chickasaw
Bluffs)&mdash;he transported all in safety to the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and into the land of Arkansas, the seventh State of
the present Union, upon whose soil these restless explorers
had set their feet.</p>

<p>They wandered towards the setting sun. Here were
vast plains filled with herds of buffalo and roving bands
of hostile redskins, from whom they learned that other
white men had preceded them, although rumors of the
adventurous Coronado’s march had traveled eastward
by word of mouth among the native inhabitants of the
plains. This Spaniard had traveled thither from Mexico,
and, could the two parties have met each other,
there would have been great rejoicing. But there was
to be no such good fortune, and De Soto’s men found
only simple, but treacherous natives.</p>

<p>The Spaniards lost some of their horses. The escape
of these was fortunate for future generations of
pioneers, as many an emigrant in later years was able
to cross the plains by capturing and taming one of the
descendants of these fugitives from the bit and the saddle.</p>

<p>The adventurers wandered about for many months,
wintered in a well-provisioned village near the Red
River, within the present State of Louisiana, then, to
the great joy of the now well-seasoned veterans, De Soto
told them that he was about to return to the great, turbid
Mississippi. He informed the wanderers that he
intended to build boats, send them down the stream
and across the Gulf of Mexico, to Cuba, and to transport
thither many other men and a plentiful supply of provisions,
so as to establish a colony in his Kingdom of
Florida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The conception was a grand one. Yet the imaginative
and jealous Castilian had not reckoned with one
powerful enemy, that cruel and unrelenting persecutor
called Death.</p>

<p>The active brain of this gallant explorer was busy
with perfecting his plans for the founding of a settlement
in the wilderness. He carefully selected the officers
and crews who were to take charge of the vessels
which he proposed to build. He chose those who were
to remain with him upon the banks of the rolling Mississippi.
Some were set to work cutting timbers; others
collected gum from pine trees; while still others put up
forges and made nails from bits of iron which they had
carried with them. All were busy and active in preparation
both for the stay of those who were to colonize
this country, and the departure of those who were to
leave. Yet the fever was in the veins of our venturesome
Castilian and his customary vigor was slackened.
De Soto grew so weakened that he had to be carried
to his tent and was delirious.</p>

<p>While upon the Red River, one of the malaria-breeding
mosquitoes had driven his tiny sting into the flesh
of the brave adventurer. He had sickened from the
poison, yet refused to give up to the disease, until the
fever was raging in his veins. He now sank rapidly.
Yellow fever had doubtless assailed him, and his system,
already weakened by much exposure and by shock
of battle, could not throw off the inroads of the dread
disease. He sank day by day. When he knew that
the end was approaching, he called his officers together,
asked their forgiveness for any wrong which he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
have done them, and named Moscoso de Alvarado to
succeed him to the command of the expedition. Officers
and bluff soldiers all swore allegiance to their new
leader. The dying explorer begged his followers to
carry out his ideas in the settlement of the vast country
of Florida, and this they promised him that they would
do.</p>

<p>One warm, sultry morning, when the mocking bird
was trilling a beautiful melody from an overhanging
sycamore, which jutted over the bank of the slow-moving,
yet turbulent Mississippi, the spirit of the bold adventurer
departed. His hardened and sunburned companions
were dewy-eyed when they gazed upon the still
countenance of their friend and kindly adviser. They
wrapped him in a sheet, rowed him to the center of the
swirling stream, dropped him overboard, and left him
amidst the silence of the great, wild country where the
“golden man” had never been found.</p>

<p>So perished De Soto, a cavalier of Spain in a day
when Spain had great warriors and noble-minded, yet
adventuresome men. As a horseman he had few superiors;
as a soldier he could bear as many privations
as any man. Towards his own cavaliers he was merciful
and just; towards the hostile natives of silent
Florida he was merciless and cruel. He was a man of
learning, of imagination, of iron will, as is exhibited
by the fact that he held his gold-worshiping supporters
to their journey long after many had sickened of the
affair and had wished to go home. At one time worth
a million dollars, the companion of Kings and of
Princes, he died in the wilderness of the New World.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
His followers drifted back to Mexico, broken in both
health and in spirit, so his ambitious dream for a colony
in the land of the fanciful El Dorado was never
consummated.</p>

<h2 class="p4">SAMUEL DE CHAMPLAIN:</h2>

<p class="pch">EXPLORER OF THE CANADIAN WILDERNESS.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1567-1635)</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">UPON the north side of the river St. Lawrence,
in Canada, and five hours’ journey by steamer
from the quaint old city of Quebec, nestles the
little village of Murray Bay. It is a picturesque,
peaceful collection of houses, where many of those who
have wealth and leisure journey in summer to enjoy
the champagne-like air and the rugged scenery. Now
a great, modern hotel rises majestically from the hemlock-covered
river-bank; but if some of the fashionable
guests who frequent it had stood there one brilliant day,
many years ago, they would have seen two pigmy vessels
holding their course up the lovely St. Lawrence.
On board was a pair of venturesome Frenchmen: the
Seigneur de Chastes and Samuel de Champlain, the
latter a youthful and energetic explorer, who looked
forward to adventures in the land of the treacherous
redman, the broad-antlered moose, and the moon-eyed
caribou.</p>

<p>This brave son of France had been born in the year
1567 in the little town of Brouage, some twenty miles
south of the seaport of La Rochelle. Little is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of his family or of his early life. His father, doubtless
the son of a fisherman, was a Captain in the navy,
and one of his uncles was a sea-pilot of some renown.</p>

<p>In youth Champlain became an excellent seaman,
but, as his country was soon embroiled in civil and
religious wars, his energies were engaged in martial
exploits upon the land, and not upon the foaming Atlantic.
Joining Henry of Navarre, he fought for the
King with zeal and enthusiasm, although he, himself,
was a Catholic, and his sovereign championed the
Huguenot or Protestant cause. Champlain, in fact,
loved country more than religion, and struggled to save
her from dismemberment. His purse was small, his
want great, and thus Henry the Fourth, from his own
slender revenues, gave him a position as Captain.</p>

<p>The war was finally over, and the youthful Champlain
conceived a design which was quite in harmony
with his adventurous nature. He would, indeed, visit
the West Indies and bring back a report of those wondrous
regions where was much peril, and where every
intruding Frenchman was threatened with death. Here
was adventure enough for any young fellow who had
the stomach for a fight.</p>

<p>No sooner conceived than executed! The hot-blooded
Frenchman was quickly on board a vessel
bound for Vera Cruz. He stopped at the West Indies,
made plans and sketches of them all, then landed upon
the Mexican Coast. He penetrated inland and was
struck with amazement at what he saw in the beautiful
City of Mexico, where Cortés had battled, bled and conquered.
He visited Panama, and,&mdash;what think you!&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
at this early date conceived the plan of shipping
freight across the Isthmus, where to-day the
United States has dug a great canal to expedite the
commerce of the world.</p>

<p>“I believe that a ship-canal, if constructed, would
shorten the voyage to the South Sea by more than fifteen
hundred miles,” he has written.</p>

<p>Oh, valorous Frenchman, had you but lived to see
your wayward dream come to be a living reality!</p>

<p>The adventurer now returned to the French Court,
that Versailles of which has been truthfully said: “It
cost one billion of francs and it took one billion drops
of the peasants’ blood to build it!” Where, also, is
the portrait of the famous soldier whose epitaph reads:
“He was invincible in peace, invisible in war.” Here
was the center of frivolity and fashion, exactly what
would weary the blood of such a backwoods soul as
Champlain. He soon tired of it and longed to plunge
again into the wilderness of the unknown West, for
there, forsooth, would be danger and hardship enough
for any man.</p>

<p>Good fortune was to be with him. At court was a
gray-haired veteran of the civil wars, who wished to
mark his closing days with some notable achievement
for France and for the church. This was Aymar de
Chastes, commander of the order of St. John, and Governor
of Dieppe. He longed to sail for Canada, or
New France&mdash;would Champlain go with him? Well,
I should think so! They embraced, shook hands upon
it,&mdash;they would seek adventure and hardship together.</p>

<p>So this is how they happened to be sailing past the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
hemlock-clad hills of Murray Bay, upon that bright,
clear morning, and I’ll warrant that, if you ever play
golf upon the course far above the town, as many of
you doubtless have often done, and you will look out
upon the great, turbid and raging river, where perhaps
you can see the bobbing back of a white porpoise, you
will think different thoughts than those which are connected
with a sliced drive or a miserable putt.</p>

<p>Like veritable gnats upon the surface of the tide-swept
stream, the vessels kept upon their way, passing
the trading-post of Tadoussac (once a flourishing settlement,
but now abandoned), the channel of Orleans,
and the spuming falls of Montmorenci. They drifted
by the brown rocks of Quebec, on, on, up the blue and
charging river, until they came opposite that rounded
mountain which lifts its head high above the present
city of Montreal. All was solitude. Sixty-eight years
before this Jacques Cartier, the navigator, had found
a numerous savage population, but now all had vanished,
and only a few wandering Algonquin redskins peered
at them from the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>Here are the fiercest of rapids, which, if you pass
through to-day, you will find to be dangerous and an
exciting adventure. The vigorous Champlain endeavored
to paddle up them with a few of the childlike
Algonquins. His courage was greater than his ability
to stem the whirling foam and tempestuous waves.
Oars, paddles, poles, and pikes could not force the thin
birch-bark canoes up the swift-moving St. Lawrence,
and he was forced to return, acknowledging himself
beaten. When he mounted the deck of his vessel, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
redmen made rude sketches upon the planking of what
he would find above, and spoke of a mighty water-fall
(Niagara Falls) where the river plunged downward in
a mass of tempestuous spray. Champlain listened with
pleasure to these stories of what lay beyond, but he had
to return, as De Chastes so willed it. After an uneventful
voyage the adventurers reached the shores of
France.</p>

<p>The gray-haired De Chastes, worn out by the rigors
of the voyage, now passed to the great beyond, leaving
his title to the great land of New France to Sieur
de Monts, who immediately petitioned the King to allow
him to colonize Acadie, a region defined as extending
from Philadelphia to Montreal. Truly these early
adventurers had magnificent ideas of distance, quite
in keeping with their ambitious designs of conquest!
The King readily gave him what he desired, so, with
one vessel, he sailed from Havre de Grace upon the seventh
day of April, 1604.</p>

<p>But how about the adventure-loving Champlain?
He remained at home not only for that year, but for
five full years, while De Monts and his men were having
plenty of hard knocks and experience in the bleak
land of New France.</p>

<p>The good seaman, in fact, quietly resided in Paris,
but his unquiet thoughts were ever turning westward.
He was enamored with the strange, hemlock-wooded
country whose rugged hills and blue rivers were mirrored
upon his memory and continually urged him to
“come back and explore!” Even as Commander
Peary has said that he pined for Arctic ice and snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
so, with restless longing, the noble-hearted Frenchman
ever sighed for days upon the broad surface of the St.
Lawrence, with starlit nights filled with the balsamy
odors of the forests. Upon the banks near the mountain
of Montreal he had determined to lay out a settlement,
from which, as a base, the waters might be traced back
far into the vast interior of the continent. With eager
and tempestuous thoughts, he yearned to be once more
scudding by the two peaks, which held high their heads
as the Saguenay discharged its swift-moving current
into the rushing St. Lawrence, far, far beneath them.</p>

<p>The danger-loving De Monts returned after four
years of adventure. To him Champlain expressed his
views, which met with a ready response. Yes, indeed,
they would go forth together, would trade with the Indians,
bring back a cargo of furs, and would found a
town by those whirling rapids, ’neath the mountain of
Montreal.</p>

<p>On April the 16th. 1604, they sailed in a ship of 150
tons from Havre de Grace, with a mixed company of
priests, Huguenot ministers, impressed rogues, and
honest settlers. Another vessel, under one Pontgrave,
had preceded them by eight days, for she was laden
with goods for the Indian trade at Tadoussac.</p>

<p>By the third of June the adventurous Champlain
neared the mouth of the Saguenay. The robust
Frenchmen eagerly breathed in the clear air of the St.
Lawrence, tinged with the faint smell of the spruce
and the balsamy hemlock. The little vessel, swept by
the tide and eddies, held its course up the stream until
the Island of Orleans was reached. Then it was run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
towards the northern bank and was anchored beneath
the high cliffs of Quebec. The men went ashore, axes
rang against the tree trunks, and soon a number of
wooden buildings arose on the brink of the St. Lawrence,
not far from the present market-place of the
Lower Town. A settlement had been founded in the
wilderness, which was to exist for centuries.</p>

<p>It was now the eighteenth day of September. Pontgrave
set sail for France, leaving Champlain with
twenty-eight men to hold Quebec throughout the winter.
October was soon upon them, October with its crystal
air, shriveling leaves and laughing sun; but it soon
passed away, and the chill of frosty winter settled
upon the little colony. It was to be a cold and cheerless
stay, and, as is always the case when men are
in need of fresh vegetables, the scurvy broke out among
the adventurers, killing many and seriously crippling
the remainder. By the middle of May, only eight men
out of the twenty-eight were alive, and of these half
were suffering from the dreadful disease. Champlain,
however, seems to have been an iron fellow, and successfully
withstood the lack of that which it is necessary
to eat in order to ward away the awful pestilence.</p>

<p>But every lane has its turning, and Spring at last
put in an appearance. Ice and snow melted under the
genial rays of the sun, the honk! honk! of the wild
geese was heard as they winged their way towards the
north, and the bluebirds warbled from the budding
maple trees. Great was the joy of the survivors of this
awful winter when they saw a sail-boat rounding the
Point of Orleans, and cheers greeted the French explorer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Marias as he cast anchor in the ice-freed river.
He brought good news. Pontgrave had been to France
and back again. He was then at Tadoussac, waiting
to speak with Champlain, and to talk of further explorations
into the wilderness.</p>

<p>The hardy explorer hastened to confer with his
friend and companion, for, in spite of the pestilence, his
giant constitution had defied the scurvy. Sailing down
the St. Lawrence, they soon met, and it was determined
between them, that, while Pontgrave remained in charge
of Quebec, Champlain should at once enter upon his
long-meditated explorations, by which, he foolishly had
hope of finding a way to China.</p>

<p>Now was to be a series of great adventures. Late
that Autumn a young chieftain from the banks of the
Ottawa River had come to visit the half-starved colonists
at Quebec, and had begged Champlain to join him,
in the Spring, in an expedition against his enemies.
These were the Iroquois, or dwellers in fortified villages
within the limit of the present State of New York,
who were a terror to all those tribes who lived north
of them. They were not only warriors of fierceness
and bold endeavor, but were also tillers of the soil, living
at ease and affluence when compared with the Indians
who fished, camped, and hunted game, near the
waters of the blue St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>About the middle of the month of May, Champlain
set forth to paddle up the river, accompanied by a
band of the Montagnais redskins. As he proceeded, he
saw the lodges of an Indian encampment thickly clustered
in the bordering forest, and, landing, found there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
his Huron and Algonquin allies. The red men were
amazed to see a person with a white skin, and gathered
about the steel-clad strangers (for he had several other
Frenchmen with him) in astonished awe and admiration.</p>

<p>“I would speak with your chieftain,” said Champlain.</p>

<p>The staring natives led him towards a great lodge
where sat not one chief, but two, for each tribe had its
own leader with them. Now there was much speech-making,
feasting, and smoking of the peace pipes;
then, all paddled down the river to Quebec, for the redskins
were anxious to view that town, the fame of
which had been borne to them in their distant habitations
of the forest.</p>

<p>The native Canadians were much interested in the
wooden houses built by the white men. They yelped in
consternation at the explosions of the French guns,
and the roar of the iron cannon. After they had examined
everything to their satisfaction, their camps
were pitched, they bedecked themselves for the war
dance, and, when night fell, leaped about, howling and
singing in the yellow glare of a huge bon-fire. Next
morning they were ready for their expedition into the
wilderness, where their enemies, the fierce Iroquois,
had dragged unfortunate members of their tribe, who
had fallen into their hands, to be beaten and tortured
with horrible indignities. No wonder they longed to
have these white men as their allies, so that they could
revenge themselves upon their enemies.</p>

<p>It was now the twenty-eighth day of May. The air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
was balmy, yet cool, so the expedition started under
pleasant auspices. Entering a small sloop, the Sieur
De Champlain pointed her nose up stream, and, accompanied
by eleven companions, and surrounded by
hundreds of redskins in birch bark canoes, set sail
for the mouth of the Rivière de Iroquois, which connects
the swirling waters of the St. Lawrence with that
beautiful lake which was to subsequently bear the name
of this venturesome explorer. The members of the
famous war-party crossed the Lake of St. Peter,
threaded the crooked channels among its many islands,
and at length started down the winding stream towards
the dreamy, gray expanse of the tempestuous lake,&mdash;afterwards
to be known as Lake Champlain,&mdash;and the
country of the Iroquois.</p>

<p>As the canoes advanced, many of the warriors went
ashore, and, spreading out, hunted for game in the
leafy forests. A provision of parched corn had been
brought along; but this was only to be used, when, owing
to the nearness of the enemy, no game could be
secured. The river widened as they went on, and
they passed great islands, many miles in extent, and
finally debouched into the rocking waters of the glittering
lake, which was ever afterwards to bear the name
of this adventurous Frenchman. He, himself, was
amazed, startled, pleased with this, his first view of the
great body of water. To the left the forest ridges of
the Green Mountains raised themselves against the
blue horizon; while to the right, the Adirondacks
stretched, themselves above the swaying spruces and
hemlocks, jutting above the woodland fringe in height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
quite equal to their sister hills across the wave-tossed
water.</p>

<p>But now they were in the country of the ferocious
Iroquois. They must use caution in their advance, for
they might be attacked at any moment. They changed
their mode of travel, lay all day hidden in the depth of
the forest, sleeping, lounging, smoking tobacco, while
at twilight they again entered the canoes and paddled
down the side of the lake until the flush of dawn began
to redden the eastern skyline. At the very end of the
water was a rocky promontory where Fort Ticonderoga
was afterwards built, and this was their objective, their
intention being to carry across into a small lake lying
to the south (Lake George) and thence to paddle southward
in search of hunting parties of the Iroquois, or of
the more southern, but equally ferocious Mohawks.
They even intended to carry their canoes to the upper
reaches of the Hudson River, should no enemies be met
with, and thus penetrate into the very heart of the Mohawk
country. They were to be spared this lengthy
journey.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock in the evening of the twenty-ninth day
of July the flotilla approached the end of the wave-tossed
lake, and, as the shadows descended, an advance
scout saw dark objects in motion upon the water before
them. They drew nearer, and, as paddles flashed to
the straining arms of the braves, suddenly a wild, unnerving
war-whoop sounded above the splashing of the
water. An Iroquois war-party was before them.</p>

<p>The hostile warriors yelled derisively, and, turning
about, paddled furiously for the shore, as they had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
desire to engage in a hand-to-hand struggle upon the
surface of the lake. They landed, rushed into the forest,
and soon the hack! hack! of their stone hatchets
and iron axes, captured in warfare, showed that they
were busily preparing a fortification. The Canadian
redskins remained upon the lake, with canoes lashed
together by means of poles, and, floating to within bowshot
of their enemies, yelled derisively at them.</p>

<p>Night descended. Those upon the lake danced in
the bottoms of their frail canoes, yelling derisively and
singing songs of defiance. Those on shore hacked
away at their fortifications, yelping dismally and boasting
of their prowess in battle. Champlain slept uneasily,
and, as day dawned, put on his breast and back
plates, his steel thigh protectors, and upon his head
his plumed casque. In his hand was his gun or arquebus,
loaded with four balls. An ammunition-box hung
over one shoulder and a long sword was by his side.
Thus he stood, respectfully gazed upon by his redskin
allies, who took him for a sort of god, come from the
Great Spirit in order to rescue them from their enemies
and bring victory to their painted braves.</p>

<p>Daylight soon came. With yells of defiance the allies
now approached the shore, and, without opposition
from the Iroquois, landed upon the beach, where they
drew up in battle array. The Iroquois defiled from
their barricade, and, as Champlain looked upon them,
he saw that they were all tall, strong men, about two
hundred in all, the fiercest and most able fighters of
North America. In the center of the line were several
chiefs, who had great headdresses of eagle and
heron plumes, and, as they advanced through the forest,
all set up a vigorous yelping, similar to a pack of wolves
in full cry. Some had shields of wood and of deerhide,
others were covered with a kind of armor made of
tough twigs interlaced together. Stealthily and steadily
they bore down upon the northern host, while afar
off, on the roughened water of the lake, a blue and
white loon screamed discordantly.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The stout-hearted Sieur de Champlain stood in the
rear of the Canadian redmen; but, as the Iroquois
drew near, his friendly braves called loudly for him to
come out in front in order to lead them on to the fray.
The good knight was eager to do so. Yet, as he stood
forth, with the sun gleaming upon his armor, the Iroquois
remained stock still and gazed at him in mute
astonishment. The Frenchman leveled his arquebus
at a gaudy chieftain, and fired. At the discharge, the
red man leaped high into the air, uttered a gurgling yell,
and fell prostrate upon the green moss. Bang! A
second redskin lurched upon his face. Then arose a
wild, alarming scream from his allies, and the air was
filled with whizzing arrows.</p>

<p>The Iroquois were no cowards and returned the barbs
with some equally as good, but, as the guns of the other
Frenchmen spoke, and numerous redskins fell to the
earth in mortal agony, they saw that here was a death-dealing
instrument which they had never met with
before. This brought confusion to their ranks. They
stood for a few moments, then broke and ran in uncontrolled
terror, while, with wonderful leaps and
bounds, the allies started in pursuit. Many of the Iroquois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
went to the Happy Hunting Grounds; but many
others were captured; while camp, canoes, provisions
and weapons were all abandoned. Terrorized and dismayed
by Champlain and his arquebus, these denizens
of the forest had been signally defeated. Thus the
scientific knowledge of the white man triumphed over
the ignorance of the Indian, and thus New France, for
the first time, rushed into contact with the renowned
warriors of the Five Nations.</p>

<p>The allies held a three hour dance in commemoration
of their victory, and when it was completed, they started
homeward, first torturing the prisoners, and killing the
majority of them. At the Falls of Chambly on the
river Richelieu, the Hurons and Algonquins went their
ways, and Champlain paddled down the St. Lawrence
with the friendly Montagnais at the rate of seventy-five,
to ninety miles, a day. At length he reached
Tadoussac, where the wives and daughters of the redskins
greeted them with a feast and war dance. All
rejoiced at the signal victory over the hated Iroquois
and sang and yelped in commemoration of the famous
battle near the rocky promontory of far distant Crown
Point.</p>

<p>The adventurous Champlain had much enjoyed this
little trip, yet, eager to report his explorations to the
French King, he sailed for France, and, after a month’s
voyage, found himself at Fontainebleau. The King was
much pleased with the news which was brought of
happenings across the wide Atlantic. He also was delighted
with a belt of porcupine quills, as a present
from the Canadian wilds, with two skins of the scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
tanager, and the pointed skull of a gar fish, unknown in
France and much appreciated.</p>

<p>By Spring the daring voyager was again upon the
ocean, headed for Tadoussac and the hills of the Laurentian
Mountains. The colony at Quebec had spent
a good winter, and had not been visited with the scurvy,
so he felt that France at last had her grip upon the
New World.</p>

<p>As he went up the river he was met by his old friends,
the Montagnais Indians, who were again upon the warpath.
Would he join them? Why, nothing suited his
fancy better! He was soon to be in a battle more
ferocious than that skirmish away off upon the bank of
the great Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>The redskins were encamped upon an island in the
river, where they were to meet the Algonquins and proceed
against a band of Iroquois, who had come there
from the south in order to have revenge for the slaughter
of the previous year. All were busy felling
branches and trees for a barricade, when suddenly an
Algonquin paddled up, crying,</p>

<p>“Arm yourselves! Get ready! The Iroquois are
not far away and have thrown up a fortification. If
you do not attack them, they will attack you!”</p>

<p>With a wild yelp of eager anticipation, the Montagnais
took to their canoes, paddled up the stream,
leaped to the shore, and were soon running through the
woods in the direction of the camp of the hated invaders.
As for Champlain, and some Frenchmen
whom he had with him, they could come along as best
they might. This they did, and, as they advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
through the forest, they heard loud shouts and battle
cries. The fight was on in earnest.</p>

<p>The Sieur de Champlain, in armored breast plate
and with greaves and arquebus, soon came into a
clearing, where he viewed a strong, log fortification.
Behind this, the Iroquois were raising an ear-splitting
din. They were firing at the attacking party of Montagnais
and Algonquins, who were afraid to advance.
The Frenchman soon saw how to bring the matter to a
successful issue.</p>

<p>“Here, my friends!” said he to the redskins.
“You must make a breach in yonder fort. As I and
my companions shower bullets at a certain point, you
must rush forward, must tear down the logs with this
rope, then all can enter and put an end to these invaders.”</p>

<p>The Indians followed his advice. As the Frenchmen
advanced and commenced firing, the redskins
rushed forward, tied ropes to the logs, and, wrenching
them away, soon made a breach in the fortress.
Champlain was hit in the ear by an arrow, but he tore
it away, although it had buried itself in his neck, and
continued the fight. As the redmen worked willingly,
a fresh band of Frenchmen approached and began to
fire upon the fort from the other side. They had come
from a trading pinnace, which had followed Champlain’s
shallop, and, hearing the sound of gun-fire,
had hurried forward in order to take part in the
fray.</p>

<p>Crash! The logs at last gave way. With a wild,
discordant war-whoop, the allies rushed forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
brandishing their knives and tomahawks, and followed
by Champlain with his men. The Iroquois, frightened
at the awful effect of the firearms, made but a
slight resistance. Some were shot upon the spot, others
ran and were killed at once, still others plunged into
the St. Lawrence, where they were drowned, while
fifteen were taken prisoners. Not one escaped the
fury of the allied assault. It had been a second glorious
victory.</p>

<p>Champlain had no further battles with the redmen,
at this time; but, a few years later, made a journey up
the Ottawa River which brought him in contact with
many of them. This was then, of course, an unknown
country, inhabited only by bands of Indians, who lived
by fishing and by hunting. The Frenchman was the
first white man to venture among the native Canadians,
so you can well imagine what must have been their
surprise and interest in viewing a warrior with a
“stick which spoke with the voice of thunder.” They
marveled at his ability to travel up the river, which was
rapid and treacherous, saying, “You must have fallen
from the clouds as you are so far from the great river
(St. Lawrence).” They gave him food, showed him
their gardens, planted with Indian corn, and sent him
on to other Indian villages, with an escort.</p>

<p>“We live here because we fear the Iroquois,” said
one chief. “But, if our white brothers will but settle
upon the great, blue river to the south of us, so that
we may be protected from these fierce warriors, we ourselves
will come down there to live.”</p>

<p>After spending some time in exploring this wild and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
beautiful country, the adventurer erected a great cross,
decorated with the arms of the King of France.</p>

<p>“You must preserve this,” he said to the savages,
“for it belongs to my Great Father beyond the sea.”</p>

<p>Then, turning about, he began the journey to Montreal.
It was June, the woods were radiant with the
flush of new foliage, deer, moose, and beaver were seen
in abundance, and even the lean, sneaking timber
wolves howled at the interlopers. The trip down the
Ottawa was swifter than the ascent and, about the middle
of June, the voyager arrived beneath the mountain
of Montreal. He bought all the furs that he could
from the Indians, and, after feasting with the French
traders and dusky sons of the forest, embarked in one
of the trading ships for France, promising to return
on the following year.</p>

<p>He did as he had said, and, addressing the redmen,
told them that it was his aim to get them to live at
peace with one another and to form a league which
would have as its object the extermination of the Iroquois.
Champlain had great ideas for New France.
He wished to have the Indians as his allies and friends.
French soldiers were to fight their battles for them.
French traders were to supply their wants. French
priests would baptize them and lead them in the ways
of the true Christian faith. It was to be an alliance
of soldier, priest, and trader.</p>

<p>The Indians were well treated by the French explorers,
who were kinder than the English and far
more hospitable. Champlain was anxious to gather
twenty-five hundred of them so as to attack the Iroquois.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
The redskins promised to collect at Montreal
at a stated time, and, believing them, the great-hearted
Frenchman traveled to Quebec for needed supplies.
When he returned, he found, to his dismay and chagrin,
a perfect solitude. The wild concourse of Algonquins,
Ottawas, and Hurons had vanished, and nothing remained
but the smoke of their fires, the skeleton poles
of their tepees and the débris from their feasting.
Impatient at the delay in waiting for him, they had
set out for their villages.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, but greatly chagrined, Champlain
determined to journey up the Ottawa to the land of the
Hurons, of whom he had heard much, but had never
seen. With two canoes, ten Indians, and two Frenchmen,
he therefore pushed up the stream, reached Lake
Nipissing, and, hearing that a still larger lake was
beyond, pressed onward to the country of the Hurons.
The scenery delighted him, for here were deep woods
of pine and of cedar, thickets full of brown rabbits and
partridges, wild grapes, plums, cherries, crab apples,
nuts, and blackberries.</p>

<p>The Hurons were soon met with; noble-looking, well-fed
savages, who took him to their tents, feasted him on
com, pumpkins and fish, and welcomed him as the
great hero who was to lead them successfully in battle
against their hated enemies, the Iroquois.</p>

<p>At length many warriors had gathered, and, with
many cries of defiance, they put boldly forth upon the
broad bosom of Lake Ontario, crossed it safely, and
landed near a bay called Hungry Bay, within the borders
of the State of New York. The canoes were hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
in the woods, and the warriors walked single file
for ten or twelve miles down the edge of the lake.
Then they struck towards the south, and, threading a
tortuous way through the forest, were soon deep within
the country of the Iroquois: their deadly and hated
enemies.</p>

<p>It was the month of October, the month of the harvest
and the month of crisp, joyous days. The rustling
leaves were just turning to gold and to crimson as the
warriors crept onward upon their mission of death.
On, on, they went, until they had approached a fortified
town of the enemy, surrounded by plowed fields,
in which were pumpkins and stalks of corn. In advance
were some young Huron braves, whose zeal out-weighed
their common sense. Seeing some Iroquois
at work among their crops, they made a rush upon them,
uttering a wild yell as they did so.</p>

<p>The hot-headed Huron warriors had counted without
their host, for, as they raced forward, the Iroquois
seized their bows and arrows, shot into their midst, and
killed and wounded a half dozen of the oncomers. The
rest were driven back, hotly pursued. But Champlain
and his Frenchmen stopped their onrush at the border
of the wood, sending them yelping to their stockade,
bearing their dead and wounded with them.</p>

<p>The battle was a three hour affair. Truly the Iroquois
were noble fighters, for, in spite of an equality
of numbers, they easily were the victors of the day,
wounding Champlain in the knee with an arrow, while
another pierced the calf of his leg. The Hurons, in
fact, had a sufficiency of battle, and, withdrawing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
their camp, waited five days for a detachment of Algonquins
which had promised to appear. They did
not come, and, in frequent skirmishes with the Iroquois,
the invaders were given all the fighting that they wished
for. At length, disheartened, the Hurons retreated to
the place where their canoes lay hidden, pursued by
parties of the Iroquois, who shot great quantities of
arrows at their retreating forms. They embarked, paddled
across the lake, and were again in their own country.</p>

<p>The Sieur De Champlain was not quite the hero
which he had been before this affair, for he had not
been found to be invulnerable. The man of iron breastplate,
fluttering plumes, and “stick which spoke with
the voice of thunder” was, after all, a common mortal.
Some of the redmen even treated him disdainfully,
for they were angered at the reception which
they had received.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the French empire-builder spent the
Winter with his redskinned allies. When Spring
came, he turned homeward, and, accompanied by an
Indian chieftain, again paddled down the Ottawa, at
length reaching Montreal, where he was welcomed as
one risen from the dead. Launching his canoe, he
journeyed to Quebec, where he received a royal welcome.
The chief was amazed at the houses, ships, and
barracks, and, after admiring all that he saw, returned
to his wigwam in the forest, bewildered and astonished
at the possessions of these fair-skinned strangers.</p>

<p>The rest of Champlain’s life was troublous, indeed,
and quite different from those venturesome experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in the wilderness. He had dedicated himself to New
France, he loved the great surging St. Lawrence River,
the wooded hills, the glorious lakes, the hemlock forests,
the spruce, the fir, and the wonderfully clear air.
He craved the wild life among the redskins, the battles
in the silent forest, the war-dance and the shrill yelpings
of victory. He reveled in the woodland scents
and sounds, the chatter of the moose-bird, the
scream of the loon, the plaintive <i>meow</i> of the lynx,
the grunt of the brown, bull moose, and the quavering
wail of the great northern diver. His eye responded
to the view of bogs, morasses, waterfalls and plunging
rapids. He was&mdash;in fact&mdash;a lover of the beautiful
in nature. In a period of unbridled license his was a
spotless life, and, like the good Chevalier Bayard, he
was a warrior without fear and without reproach.</p>

<p>A British fleet, sailing up the St. Lawrence, found
the little town of Quebec, which the good Chevalier had
built, with a garrison of but sixteen, and these half
famished. They were ordered to surrender, were captured,
were convoyed to their own country (each soldier
with furs to the value of twenty crowns with him) and
the cross of St. George of England was planted upon
the crumbling walls of the citadel. Yet Champlain
was again to return, for, by a treaty between France
and England, at this time, New France was restored
to the French crown. The founder of this struggling
colony reassumed command of Quebec in the following
May.</p>

<p>Two years now passed, years of pleasurable toil,
among the Indians, for priests and soldiers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
crown. A mission was established amongst the Hurons,
a trading post at Three Rivers, and the authorities
in France begged for troops with which to
attack the vindictive Iroquois. But Cardinal Richelieu,
who governed the destinies of the nation, had
enough to do at home and cared little for the affairs
of this far-distant wilderness colony. Harassed by
anxieties, Champlain became more pious, grave and
stern, as the years passed on. He had married, but his
wife remained in Europe, where she became a nun; so
the bold explorer made his will, leaving all of his little
property to the Church.</p>

<p>Christmas day, 1635, was a bright day overhead,
and the sun shone brilliantly upon the snow, but it was
a dark day in the annals of New France. For in a
chamber of the old fort at Quebec, breathless and cold,
lay the hardy frame of the great explorer, the man of
the sea, the wilderness, the palace, and the wigwam.
The grave, the valiant Champlain was dead at the age
of sixty-eight. His labors for his beloved New France
were over and he had ceased to watch over the destinies
of his struggling people. He was buried with a simple
ceremony, which was attended by Jesuits, officers, soldiers,
traders, Indian braves, and the few settlers of
the quaint, little town. A tomb was erected to his
honor and his remains thus rested near the scenes of
his explorations, his adventures, and his dreams of empire
for his beloved country.</p>

<p class="pch">DISCOVERER OF HUDSON BAY AND EXPLORER<br />
OF THE MAGNIFICENT RIVER<br />
WHICH BEARS HIS NAME</p>

<p class="pch2">(15??-1611)</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">WE had been plowing along over the great Atlantic
on a clear and starlit night. The
<i>Mauretania</i> was as steady as a pier in the
East River, so we were expecting no disaster, yet, when
we tumbled from our cots upon the day following, we
were startled to see that the great, steel hulk had ceased
to move with her accustomed vigor. The resounding
<i>poom, poom</i>, of her giant propeller-shaft was no longer
heard, and she was only just drifting along through the
gray-green waters. Every now and again her massive
fog-whistle would roar out its leonine warning:</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o-o-m! O-o-o-o-o-m!”</p>

<p>We stumbled to the deck, only to be chilled and
dampened by a shroud of mist, which had shut down
upon our steel-clad home like a giant pall. It curled,
rolled and settled upon us as if it were a blanket saturated
with dank sea-water; it cut off the view, so that
one peered at the swishing ocean in vain; and it benumbed
one, so that one’s voice was stifled and choked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
as if a huge overpowering hand were grasping at one’s
throat. And even from above came that soul-deadening
roar of the steam siren:</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o-o-m! O-o-o-o-o-m!”</p>

<p>In the blinding mist I bumped into a sailor.</p>

<p>“Avast there, my lad,” said he. “Can’t you get
your sea legs?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “Where are we?”</p>

<p>“Off the banks.”</p>

<p>“And the fog?”</p>

<p>“Usual thing. She’ll burn off in a couple of hours.
We have to go easy because of the Gloucester fishing
fleet. Hear them!”</p>

<p>Indistinctly, in the murky pall, I seemed to hear the
thin whining of numberless, tin fish-horns.</p>

<p>“Pretty weak fog-whistles, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>But just then something happened.</p>

<p>The mist seemed to part as if rent by a strong and
virile hand. We could see the great, combing, green
billows go careening and bobbing by, as the cloud-bank
shifted like a veil, and there, tossing restlessly on the
waves, was a long, brown boat! A number of men were
in her, all huddled together in a heap. They were
dressed in old-fashioned garments and their faces were
drawn, haggard, pinched. In the stern sat a bearded
man holding fast to the tiller, at his feet lay a slender
youth.</p>

<p>The vista lasted but for a moment or two and then
the fog-bank rolled in again, hiding the picture from
our startled, yet eager visions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked I, breathlessly, as the sailor
lurched against my side.</p>

<p>“Henry Hudson and his crew,” he answered, with a
hoarse chuckle.</p>

<p>And as I stumbled below, I thought that perhaps the
weather-beaten sea-dog might be correct.</p>

<p class="p2">If you had happened to be sitting upon the beach of
Manhattan Island, near the spot where is now the Battery,
upon the eleventh day of September, 1609, you
would have seen a curiously shaped vessel floating,
lazing, along near the shore, and you would have also
seen a number of weather-scarred navigators who were
anxiously peering at the beach. The name of this boat,
with a high poop and a curving prow, was the <i>Half
Moon</i>, and her captain was Henry Hudson, or Hendrick
Hudson, as he is sometimes called.</p>

<p>He was not only pleased, but also interested to see a
land where was a goodly lot of timber, lovely islands
and broad harbors, pearly beaches and dusky-bodied inhabitants,
who seemed to be peacefully inclined.</p>

<p>And who was this fellow Henry, who had dared to
come to explore that island of Manhattan, where the
mighty Woolworth Building was to rise up in all its
splendor, as if to laugh at the former simplicity and
quiet of the brush-covered strip of sandy soil?</p>

<p>Of the early history of the bold mariner hardly anything
is known. He was a native of England, a contemporary
and friend of the famous Captain John
Smith, the settler of Virginia, and, like him, was a professional
navigator and intrepid adventurer. He resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
in London, was married, and had a son, to whom
he was devotedly attached.</p>

<p>When Hudson was living in London, there were a
great many merchants there who were anxious to learn
of a northern and westward route to the East Indies,
from which they imported teas, spices, and many other
articles. The commerce of this country was now
brought partly over land and then floated through the
Mediterranean Sea. It was a slow and laborious route
for trade, so those nations farthest removed from the
advantages of that route (such as Spain, Portugal, and
England), became restless, and most desirous of finding
a new and a shorter passage to the East Indies.</p>

<p>In the year 1499, a celebrated Portuguese navigator,
called Vasca de Gama, had doubled the Cape of Good
Hope, and, passing onward, had appeared upon the
coast of Hindustan. He had brought back word of the
southern route, but it was such a long and dangerous
passage, that the nations of Europe were not satisfied
with it. They desired a shorter highway to the wealth
of the East, and began to think that they might find it
by sailing through the Arctic Ocean, and, passing northwestwardly
around the coast of North America, might
journey around the shore of Asia to the Indies with
their marvelous wealth.</p>

<p>A number of rich men who lived in the city of London
joined themselves together as a London Company
in the year 1607, and raised sufficient money to purchase
a ship and supply it with provisions for a journey
to the northwest. Knowing that everything depended
upon the skill of the commander, they chose, as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
leader, Henry Hudson, who readily accepted the position.</p>

<p>Upon a bright day in April, the Captain and crew
went to the church of Saint Ethelburge in Bishopsgate
Street, and there received the sacrament of the Lord’s
Supper. There were eleven seamen in all, among whom
was John Hudson, son of the daring sea captain. It
was a pious and beautiful custom of those ancient times
for seamen to thus act before entrusting themselves to
the mercy of the seas, where they were to meet with
unknown perils.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem to us now, the object of this
voyage was to find a passage directly across the North
Pole to Japan and China. Imagine these brave fellows
setting out in one of the small vessels of those days to
sail to the Pole! It seems absurd, for, even with a vessel
specially constructed to meet the ice packs, Commodore
Peary had great difficulty in keeping his vessel, the
<i>Roosevelt</i>, from being crushed. Yet, with their flimsy
craft, these adventurers started out in quest of the much-desired
North West passage.</p>

<p>On May 1st. 1607, the navigators weighed anchor at
Gravesend, and, taking a northerly course, in twenty-six
days reached the Shetland Isles. Leaving these
wild, rocky shores behind them, they now steered northwest,
and, in a week’s time, although they discovered
no land, they had the satisfaction of seeing six or seven
whales near the ship. Two days later, at 2 o’clock
upon a foggy morning, land was seen ahead of them.
It was high, covered with snow, and, at the top, it
looked reddish; underneath a blackish color, with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
ice lying about. There were also great quantities of
ducks and other wild-fowl along the coast, and a whale
spouted near the shore. This was the peninsula of
Greenland.</p>

<p>Thick fogs now shut down upon the mariners, accompanied
by storms of rain and of snow. The vessel was
sometimes driven before a heavy gale of wind; at other
times becalmed. Yet, in spite of this, Hudson still
held on in a northeasterly course, hoping to sail around
the land in front of him and thus to reach the passage
across the North Pole. At last, discouraged at his
slow progress, he determined to steer in an easterly direction,
hoping to find an island which was called Newland
upon the charts.</p>

<p>After sailing about sixteen miles, the ship came
within sight of land and many birds were seen flying
over it with black and white stomachs, and in form
like a duck. Fogs again set in and much floating ice
was encountered, yet the vessel was headed onward in
a northeasterly direction. Land was seen at different
intervals and the weather was both temperate and pleasant.
So, again steering eastward, the ship struggled
on against hard winds and heavy fogs until it had
reached the coast of Spitzbergen.</p>

<p>Great numbers of whales were playing around in a
bay which they ran into, and, while one of the men was
amusing himself with a hook and a line overboard, in
order to try for a bite, one of the monster fish dove under
the vessel and caught upon his line. All the sailors
feared that they would be upset, but the big, black fellow
made off without doing them any serious damage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“By God’s mercy,” says Hudson, in his diary, “we
had no harm but the loss of the hook and three parts
of the line.”</p>

<p>After sailing along the coast for some time, again the
mariner headed for Greenland, hoping to steer around
it, towards the north, and then return to England.
But fogs, storms, and floating ice interfered with his
journey, to such an extent, that he was forced to turn
around and head for the place from which he had
started.</p>

<p>Thus, after a hard voyage of four months and a half,
he sailed up the river Thames, beaten in his effort to
find the North West passage, yet with the news of many
lands which no Englishman had yet seen. His employers
greeted him warmly and were sufficiently well
pleased with his success to trust him with a second adventure,
for he had been farther north than any navigator
who had preceded him, and had opened the commerce
of the whale fishery to his countrymen. He was
also the re-discoverer of Spitzbergen, which had first
been seen by one William Barentz, a Dutch navigator,
in the year 1596.</p>

<p>Spring had no sooner opened, in the year following,
than Hudson commenced making his preparations for
a second voyage. This time he was to endeavor to seek
the passage for the East Indies by passing between
Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. Thus, with a crew of
fifteen persons, and his son John, he set sail from London
on the twenty-second day of April, heading north,
where lay the region of ice and snow.</p>

<p>At one time the vessel would meet large quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of drift-wood driving by in a confused mass; then large
numbers of whales and porpoises would be met with,
and the sea would be covered with multitudes of birds.
Then again the mariners would come across numbers
of seals lying about upon cakes of ice, and polar bears
would lumber away over the glistening ice-pack. Two
of the sailors, also, said that they saw a mermaid close
to the side of the ship, but a big wave came along and
overturned her. As she went down into the surging
brine they saw her tail, which was similar to the tail
of a porpoise, and was speckled like a mackerel.</p>

<p>After sighting land, and exploring numberless bays
and harbors, Hudson finally reached a great sound, into
which emptied a stream. The vessel was anchored, and
five men were sent forward in a boat to explore this
river, in order to see whether or not the water-course
dipped to the south and led to a passage through to
Asia. But the water became very shallow, as the explorers
proceeded, so they came back and reported that
the vessel could not venture farther upon its way. As
the provisions were now getting somewhat low, Hudson
decided to steer for England. This he did, entering
the peaceful Thames, after an absence of about four
months. He was not received with the same cordiality
which had greeted him after his first voyage. His employers
had grown discouraged by these two unsuccessful
attempts to find a shorter route to Asia.</p>

<p>The members of the London Company, in fact, refused
to lend any more money or supplies to Mr. Henry
Hudson, so that gallant gentleman took a jaunt to Holland
in order to offer his services to the Dutch East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
India Company. His fame had preceded him, and he
was greeted with cordial respect. A small ship was
given to him called the <i>Half Moon</i>, and he was requested
to go forth once more and discover the North
West passage, upon which his heart was set. With a
crew consisting of twenty Englishmen and Dutchmen,
among whom was the same mate who had served with
him upon his last voyage, he was now ready to brave
again the ice and storms of the Arctic seas.</p>

<p>Upon March the 25th., the experienced navigator
left New Amsterdam, and was ere long upon the coast
of Nova Zembla, when he met with so much ice and
fog, that he gave up any hope of reaching India by this
route.</p>

<p>But Hudson was made of no common clay, and, although
beaten by the elements, which denied him a
northern route, determined to sail to America, that land
about which every one in Europe was hearing such
wonderful stories. Furthermore, he had with him
some maps which had been given him by his old friend,
Captain John Smith, on which a strait was marked,
south of the fair land of Virginia, by which he might
reach the Pacific Ocean and the East Indies. Then,
too, he might gain a passage through to the northwest,
by means of Davis Strait. Why not? He asked his
crew about it, and they voted, to a man, to sail westward.
Many of these bronzed sea-dogs had been trained
in the East Indies service, were accustomed to sailing
in warm, tropical climates, and therefore chose to sail
south, rather than to meet the fog, the ice, and the chill
tempests of the northern seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Heading towards the West, the <i>Half Moon</i> soon
reached one of the Faroe Islands, where the casks were
filled with fresh water, and then the sails were again
hoisted, and a course was set towards Newfoundland.
Early in July the Grand Banks were reached, where was
a great fleet of French fishing smacks, which had come
this great distance in order to catch cod and haddock.
As the <i>Half Moon</i> was now becalmed for several days,
the crew was sent to the banks to try their luck, and, in
one day, one hundred and thirty cod-fish were captured.
The wind now freshened, so the mariners sailed towards
the west. They soon cleared the banks, passed
the shore of Nova Scotia, and, on the morning of the
12th, saw the coast of North America before them.
Clouded by fog banks, but brown, rock-ribbed, pine-clad,
lay the wonderful country which was inhabited
by the deer, the beaver, the moose, and the red Indian.</p>

<p>The <i>Half Moon</i> careened along for several days at
some distance from the land, as the fog was so thick,
that Hudson feared to approach. Finally the sun
burned through the mist and the mariners ran into a
goodly harbor at the mouth of a large river. It was
Penobscot Bay, upon the coast of Maine, as beautiful
then as it is now.</p>

<p>As the ship was lying-to off the harbor, unable to
enter because of the fog, two birch-bark canoes had approached
them, with six natives of the country, who
seemed delighted to see the mariners. Captain Hudson
gave them some glass beads and other trinkets,&mdash;then
they ate and drank with him. One of the natives
could speak a little French and told them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
French people were in the habit of trading with them,
and that they had gold, copper, and silver mines near by.</p>

<p>When the <i>Half Moon</i> entered Penobscot Bay, great
numbers of the redskins paddled out to the vessel,
climbed on board, and eagerly gazed upon the sailors,
as they mended the sails and made a new foremast.
Some of the mariners went ashore to get a needed supply
of water, while others amused themselves by catching
lobsters,&mdash;not in a lobster-pot, you may be sure,
but in a small net baited with fish.</p>

<p>Hudson’s men seemed to have had a foolish distrust
of the redskins. The Indians were friendly and wished
to trade beaver-pelts and fine furs for hatchets, beads,
and knives; yet the mariners were so suspicious that
they kept a strict watch upon the ship in order to see
that no natives approached under cover of the darkness.
At last, their mast being ready, these navigators
manned a boat with twelve men armed with muskets,
and, landing upon the shore, made a savage attack upon
the peaceful red men, whom they drove from their
houses. It is to the disgrace of Hudson that he allowed
this to happen, the only excuse that can be offered
being that he had under his command a wild and
ungovernable lot of uneducated Dutch and Englishmen.</p>

<p>Having perpetrated this act of cruelty, the adventurers
set sail, steering southward along the coast of
America, and, in a short time came within sight of
Cape Cod. They sounded and found the water quite
deep within bowshot of the shore, and, proceeding to
the land, discovered grapes and rose-trees, which they
brought on board their ship. The <i>Half Moon</i> was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
sailed towards the shore and was anchored there. Here
Hudson heard voices calling to him from the beach,
and, thinking that they might be the cries of some poor
sailors who had been left behind, he immediately sent
a part of the crew in a boat to land. Upon jumping
out upon the sand, it was found that the calls had been
made by Indians, who appeared to be greatly rejoiced
to see them. The men returned to the ship, bringing
one of the natives on board with them, whom they fed,
presented with a few glass buttons, and then put ashore
in the boat. When the redskin reached the land, he
gave every manifestation of great joy, by dancing,
leaping, and throwing up his hands. Then letting out
a wild and uncouth yell, he disappeared into the brush.</p>

<p>Amused and interested, Hudson now steered southeast,
and soon passed the southern point of Cape Cod,
which he knew to be the headland which Bartholomew
Gosnold had discovered in 1602, seven years before.
He sailed by Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard and
kept upon his course due south, until, upon the 18th.
day of August, he found himself at the entrance of
Chesapeake Bay, where, two years before, the first English
settlement had been made in America. Hudson
was filled with great admiration for these broad waters,
and, keeping on, reached the thirty-fifth degree of latitude,
or a position which made him certain that there
was no passage to the South Pacific Ocean, as John
Smith had said. So, retracing his course, he passed
the shores of Maryland and discovered the great bay of
Delaware.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is a good land to fall in with, and is a pleasant
land to see,” writes Hudson in his diary, transcribed
as the <i>Half Moon</i> was sailing off the shore of Long
Branch, New Jersey. The weather was dark and
misty, so, sending some men inshore in order to find
out the depth of the water, the vessel was headed inland,
and, upon the morning of September third, was anchored
within Sandy Hook, in five fathoms of water.
The next morning, this bold navigator saw that there
was “good anchorage and a safe harbor,” so he steered
his little vessel within the bay of Sandy Hook, at a
distance of two cable lengths from the shore, resting in
the famous harbor of New York.</p>

<p>Could Henry Hudson have looked forward through
the years and have seen the city of tall buildings,
wharves, cobbled streets and rolling elevated-trains
which was to cover the island of Manhattan, then lying
tranquilly before his gaze, he would doubtless have
passed a night of restless nightmare. But he had no
forward vision, and, as he feasted his eyes upon a long
beach of white sand, behind which were low scrubby
bushes, plum trees, grape vines, and twisted oaks, he
peacefully smoked a long pipe which an Indian brave
had given him, and dreamed of discovering a passage to
Asia.</p>

<p>The ship lay drowsily at anchor, and, as it swung
upon its chain, many redskins came paddling out from
the shore, clambered on board, and seemed to be delighted
to see these strange visitors. They were dressed
in well-cured deer-skins, which hung loosely over their
shoulders, and had many ornaments of copper scattered
upon their persons. They brought ears of corn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
them and also tobacco, which they wished to exchange
for beads, for knives, and for other trinkets. The
sailors had much fun in bartering with them and in
smoking their stone pipes.</p>

<p>The ship rode snugly at anchor, but during the night
a gale sprang up, which was of such fury, that the anchor
dragged, and the <i>Half Moon</i> was soon high and
dry upon the Jersey beach. But she was not even
strained, as the bottom was “soft and oozy,” and when
flood-tide came along she was easily towed into deep
water. Yet, this was of great interest to the native inhabitants,
who crowded eagerly to the shore: men,
women and children. They were also very kind, giving
the sailors presents of dried currants and green tobacco.
Notwithstanding this, the mariners suspected
them of treachery and kept continually upon their
guard.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson saw that a large river emptied into
this bay, where lay the <i>Half Moon</i>, so he sent five men
in order to explore and discover how far he could go.
They passed through what is now known as the Narrows,
found the land to be covered with trees, grass,
and flowers, the fragrance of which was delightful, and,
after going six miles into New York Bay, turned back.
Now an unhappy event was to occur, yet one which
showed that the distrust of the natives was a well-founded
prejudice.</p>

<p>The boat was being driven along toward the ship,
just at dusk, when it was attacked by two canoes containing
twenty-six redskinned warriors of old-time New
York. Rain was falling, so it was impossible to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the ancient muskets, or match-locks, which were touched
off by means of a lighted fuse. The white men could
therefore make no defense and rowed off as fast as they
could, while a shower of Indian arrows fell into the
boat, striking three of the explorers in the body. One
of them, John Colman, was killed by an arrow which
struck him in the neck. He had been with Hudson in
his first voyage and was greatly loved by the brave and
resolute navigator.</p>

<p>In this, the first boat race in New York harbor between
the redskins and the whites, the white men were
victorious, for they escaped into the darkness and wandered
around all night. In the dim gray of the early
morn they found the ship; climbed thankfully on board,
and told of their experience with some show of anxiety,
for they feared a general attack from the red men.
None came, however, and the dead body of Colman was
taken ashore at Sandy Hook, where it was buried in the
soil at a place called Colman’s Point.</p>

<p>Just as soon as the burying party had returned to
the ship, the boat was hoisted in, and bulwarks were
erected upon the sides in order to repel the expected
Indian attack. But none came. The night was quiet,
only the lapping of the water around the ship’s bow
could be heard, and, when day dawned, numerous redskins
paddled out to the vessel in the most friendly manner,
bringing corn and tobacco to trade with the sailors.
From their actions, it appeared that they knew nothing
of the battle upon the previous day, and they left in
good humor, promising to return next morning with
more provisions and many beaver-skins for trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>In the flush of the early dawn, two large canoes came
off to the <i>Half Moon</i>, one filled with men armed with
bows and arrows, who seemed to be in war paint. Hudson
was suspicious of treachery, so only allowed two of
the braves to come on board, whom he dressed up in red
coats. The remaining savages returned to the shore,
and presently another canoe approached in which were
two lone warriors. One of them was allowed to come
on deck, Hudson intending to keep him as a hostage to
insure the good behavior of his fellow citizens on the
Isle of Manhattan.</p>

<p>The redskins, however, did not seem to like their
fair-skinned brothers, and one immediately dove into
the sea and swam hastily ashore. Expecting an immediate
attack, Hudson weighed anchor and floated the
<i>Half Moon</i> off into the channel of the Narrows, where
he again anchored for the night. He expected an assault,
but none came, so he set sail, next morning, for
the Bay of New York, which he says that he found to
be “an excellent harbor for all winds.” He again anchored,
and the <i>Half Moon</i> was soon surrounded by the
Indians, who were apparently friendly “making a great
show of love, and giving tobacco and Indian wheat.”
The navigators, however, were afraid of an attack and
kept continually upon their guard, yet the red men departed
to the shore, and all was peace and quiet, save
for the mewing of the sea gulls and the squawking of a
great blue heron, as he winged his way to the inland
marshes.</p>

<p>The dreamy haze of September hung over the swirling,
blue river as Henry Hudson gazed up the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
which was to ever afterwards bear his name, and, upon
the morning of the twelfth, he weighed anchor, and
steered towards the northwest. Twenty-eight canoes
had visited him that morning, filled with redskinned
men, women and children, who had brought oysters and
clams to trade for blue beads and glass trinkets. The
braves smoked great tobacco pipes of yellow color and
their cheeks were smeared with red ochre, so that the
mariners were suspicious of them, and, although they
traded with them, allowed none to come upon the deck.</p>

<p>The wind was unpropitious, so the <i>Half Moon</i> only
sailed about two leagues, when it anchored for the
night. Yet, next day, the wind was fresher, so the
vessel proceeded to travel about eleven miles, until it
came opposite the present town of Yonkers, where the
anchor was again let down. The redskins immediately
crowded around the boat, but none were allowed to come
on board, as the navigators feared treachery.</p>

<p>The weather continued to be fair, so the <i>Half Moon</i>
proceeded upon her way, and, driven by a strong breeze,
finally anchored in a region where the land was very
high and mountainous, evidently the neighborhood of
the Highlands and near the present site of the West
Point Military Academy. No cries of “Battalion, Attention!”
“Squads, Right!” or “Forward, March!”
then echoed from the peaceful shore; instead of this,
the mariners heard the hooting of a great, brown owl,
while far off upon the mountain-side glimmered the
camp-fire of a straggling band of Indians. As night
descended upon the wilderness, the scream of a panther
reverberated from the dense foliage of the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
hills, which were beautiful with the first changing colors
of autumn. The stream was narrowing, instead of
expanding, so, thought Hudson, could it be possible
that, after all, there was no passage to the East Indies?</p>

<p>A filmy mist hung over the rippling waters of the
stream, next morning, but as the sun shone, a clear wind
arose which seemed to blow it away. As Hudson gave
orders to his men to haul up the anchor, a sudden splash
near the vessel’s side made him run to the gunwale
and look eagerly into the water, expecting to see a small
whale, or a porpoise. Instead, the head of a redskin
bobbed up in the ripples of the stream, as with furious
strokes, one of the braves who had been held prisoner,
swam towards the shore. Another head appeared.
The two red men, who had been held as hostages, had
escaped through the port hole.</p>

<p>The Indians soon reached the banks of the stream,
climbed out, and standing there with clenched fists,
shook them vindictively at the white men, making loud
and angry cries. Not at all worried at the happening,
Hudson kept on up the now narrowing river, passed
by high mountains upon either side, and finally came
in sight of other mountains, about fifty miles from his
former anchorage. Here the redskins came out to view
the curious vessel, and, says Hudson in his journal,
they were “very loving people and very old men, who
treated us very kindly.” The anchor was cast and a
boat was sent off with sailors to catch fish, of which
there was a great abundance.</p>

<p>Going ashore, next day, the brave navigator there met
an old chieftain who lived in a circular house and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
surrounded by forty men and seventeen women. The
aged redskin was hospitably inclined and begged the
white man to come and feast with him, an invitation
which Hudson readily accepted. Two mats were immediately
spread for him to sit upon and food was
brought forward in large, red bowls made of wood.
Several natives were meantime dispatched into the
woods in search of game.</p>

<p>After awhile the braves returned with a pair of
pigeons which were roasted upon the fire. A feast was
now held, consisting of corn, beans, pigeon and fat
dog, after which Hudson was requested to spend the
night. “I must return,” said the mariner, but this
seemed to worry the chief redskin, so that his people
took all of their arrows, and, breaking them in pieces,
threw them into the fire, as they supposed that the explorer
was afraid of them. However, Hudson would
not remain in the wigwam, preferring to sleep among
his own compatriots.</p>

<p>After trading with the red men, who brought Indian
corn, pumpkins and tobacco to the ship, the <i>Half Moon</i>
was again steered up-stream, until the water was found
to be very shoal. This was probably near the spot
where the city of Hudson has grown up. The weather
was warm and enervating, but the vessel was kept upon
her course until she reached several small islands in the
middle of the river, and also very shallow water, which
made it impossible to proceed. As night came on, the
vessel drifted near the shore and grounded. But she
was floated off by means of an anchor, and again lay
peacefully in the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Hudson had now proceeded about as far as he could
go, and saw that it was impossible to reach the East
Indies by way of the winding water-course upon which
his vessel lay. His men who had been sent up-stream
to explore, in the small boat, brought back word that
there was nothing but still shallower water above. So
it was apparent that the vessel must return to the sea
again, and another passage must be sought for. Yet,
before he returned, he determined to make an experiment
with some of these many Indians who were crowding
about his vessel, in order to learn if they were really
treacherous, or were peacefully inclined. This experiment
was to be by means of the famous Holland gin, or
“fire water” of the white men, and it was decided to
place some of the red men under its influence.</p>

<p>Next day, several of the Indian braves were invited
down to the broad cabin of the <i>Half Moon</i>, where gin
and brandy was given them, until they were all as merry
as a marriage bell.</p>

<p>Their squaws looked innocently on as their lords and
masters betook plentifully of the cup that cheers, and
saw all of them become, first merry, then boisterous,
then drowsy. Finally one Indian brave became so
deeply intoxicated that he fell asleep upon a bench,
snoring with right good will. All of his companions
now arose in great fright, for they feared that he was
poisoned. Taking to their canoes, they cried out with
some show of anger: “You pale faces have sent our
brother to the Land of the Great Spirit. Ugh! Ugh!
You have poisoned him!” They did not, however, forget
their poor companion, and several soon returned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
bringing with them long strings of beads which they
offered to Hudson, saying: “Take these, brother, and
let us have our miserable friend. He has gone to the
Land of the Hereafter!” But the mariner declined,
answering:</p>

<p>“Let your brother sleep. He is safe with us and
will get well. The Great Spirit is watching over him
and you need fear nothing.”</p>

<p>The redskin slept peacefully all night, and, when his
frightened countrymen came out to see him, next day,
they were rejoiced to find him alive and smiling. Crying
out, “Ugh! Ugh! The white man was right.
The Great Spirit has looked carefully after our
brother,” the red men paddled him joyfully to the shore,
but soon returned, bringing beads and tobacco, which
they gave to Hudson. They also presented him with a
large platter of venison. “Pray take this, brother,”
said a bronze-skinned chieftain. “We love our brother,
for he has let no harm come to our beloved friend who
has loved the fire water far too well. Ugh! Ugh!”</p>

<p>Disappointed in not finding the passage to the far
East, Hudson now prepared to return. But how far
had he gone? Writers seem to disagree upon this
point, yet, when one considers that the <i>Half Moon</i> was
a small boat, not as large as many of the stone sloops
which now sail in the North River, it is reasonable to
suppose that it went up the Hudson to a place about in
the neighborhood of where Albany now stands, while
the boat which was sent on ahead to explore the stream,
advanced as far as the town of Waterford.</p>

<p>It was now the twenty-seventh day of September, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
weather was balmy, and the leaves of the forest were
turning with the first chill of Autumn. The <i>Half
Moon</i> drifted slowly down the broadening river, passing
the home of the hospitable, old chieftain, near
Catskill’s Landing. The redskin came out in his
canoe, begging Hudson to come ashore and eat with
him; but the wind was too fresh for the navigator to
listen to his invitation, so the boat kept on down-stream,
leaving the old chief “very sorrowful for their departure.”
Toward night the vessel anchored near what
is now known as Red Hook Landing, where the sailors
had splendid fishing in the blue depths of the magnificent
water-course.</p>

<p>Now, detained for a day by head winds, the ship
dropped slowly down the river, passing the famous
highlands of the Hudson where the mountains looked
as if there were some metal, or mineral in them.
“The hills seemed to be all blasted, some of them barren
with few or no trees on them.” The Indians still
crowded around the boat, several of them bringing a
stone on board which was like emery, for it would cut
iron or steel. On the 1st day of October, with a fair
wind behind, the <i>Half Moon</i> sailed through the highlands,
and, reaching a point opposite Stony point, was
becalmed, and cast anchor.</p>

<p>No sooner had the pronged holding-iron touched bottom
than the redskins came crowding around, astonished
at everything they saw, and desirous of trade.
They offered pumpkins, beaver skins, and dried plums
for exchange, but apparently could not procure all that
they wished, for one fellow was prompted to steal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Paddling his birch bark canoe near the stern of the
<i>Half Moon</i>, he crawled up the rudder into the cabin
window and made off with a pillow and some clothes.
Jumping stealthily into his canoe, he paddled away as
fast as he was able, but was seen by the Mate, who shot
and killed him. As he dropped lifeless into the stern
of his canoe, the remaining red men fled in terror, some
even leaping overboard to swim for it. Meanwhile the
ship’s boat was manned and a number of sailors were
sent to rescue the stolen articles, which were easily obtained.
As the boat headed for the <i>Half Moon</i>, one of
the swimming redskins took hold of the stern and endeavored
to overturn her. When he did this, the cook
drew a sword, and, making a vicious blow at him, cut
off his hand. Shrieking with pain, the poor creature
sank to the bottom, never to rise again. The sailors
hastened their rowing, were soon on board the ship, and,
fearing an attack, hoisted sail in order to drop down
the stream to the mouth of the Croton River.</p>

<p>The next day was a clear one, with a fair wind, so
the <i>Half Moon</i> sailed twenty-one miles to a position
somewhere near the head of Manhattan Island, where
there was quite a deal of trouble in store for these
valiant navigators. As you remember, on the way up
the stream, Hudson had held two red men captive, who
had escaped through the porthole. These had returned
to their fellows, angry and indignant at their captivity,
and had raised their compatriots to a revengeful spirit
against these white interlopers. The warriors had assembled
along the shores of the river, and, as the <i>Half
Moon</i> approached, a canoe neared the vessel, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
was one of those who had escaped, and many others,
armed with bows and with arrows. Although they attempted
to come on board, the wise Hudson would not
allow this to be done. Showing anger by their gesticulations,
the redskins withdrew, but presently two canoes
filled with armed warriors dropped under the stem and
began to attack the vessel by showering arrows at her.
The mariners fired six muskets at the red men and three
of them fell dead in the bottom of their birch-bark
canoes.</p>

<p>The Indians who were on the shore, and had been
keeping a keen watch upon the affair, now moved down
to the beach in a solid body (there were about one hundred
in all) and shot arrows at the ship, as she floated
by. A cannon was now loaded with ball and was discharged
among them, whereby two of them fell mortally
wounded. The remainder fled into the woods,
with the exception of nine or ten desperate men, who,
resolved upon revenge, jumped into a canoe and advanced
to fight the ship at close quarters. But the
cannon was again discharged, the canoe was pierced by
the ball, and three or four redskins were killed by musket
shots. The rest swam to shore.</p>

<p>The ship was sailing slowly onward, and, after skirting
the shore for about two miles, dropped anchor beneath
the cliffs at Hoboken. The day following was a
stormy one, but the fourth of October was clear, with an
excellent wind, so the <i>Half Moon</i> weighed anchor,
passed through the bay, and, with all sails set, shoved
her nose into the swirling billows of the broad Atlantic,
leaving the noble river far astern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>The mate was in favor of wintering in Newfoundland,
and of then seeking a passage to the Far East
by means of the Davis Strait, but Hudson opposed
this. The course of the <i>Half Moon</i> was kept in a line
for England, where, on the seventh day of November,
after an absence of a little more than seven months from
Amsterdam, she glided into the harbor of Dartmouth.
The crew, as you doubtless remember, was composed
partly of English, partly of Dutch sailors, and, it is
said that the Englishmen refused to allow their Captain
to sail into a Dutch harbor. Dutch historians declare,
that, as the English King was jealous of the bold
mariner’s enterprises, he was not allowed to sail to
Holland. At any rate, Hudson remembered his duty
to his employers, and sent them a journal and chart
of his discoveries, pointing with great pride to what
he called “the Great River of the Mountains.” The
Dutch soon came over to settle the new-found country,
and named the stream the North River, to distinguish
it from the Delaware, or South River. The Indians
called it Cahohatatea, Mahackaneghtue, and sometimes
Shatemuck.</p>

<p>This successful voyage had now given Hudson a great
name, and his discoveries fired his old employers of the
London Company with enthusiasm. So they again
called him into their service, determined to make an
effort to find the North West passage by examining the
inlets of this wonderful continent of America,&mdash;more
particularly Davis Strait, through which it was supposed
a channel might be found into the “Great South
Sea.” Hudson was furnished with the ship <i>Discovery</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of fifty-five tons, which, equipped and manned with
twenty-three men, set out for the Far West. This journey
was to be his last one.</p>

<p>Upon the 17th. of April, 1610, the <i>Discovery</i> passed
out of the mouth of the Thames, and, sailing near the
coast of Scotland, the Orkney, Shetland and Faroe Islands,
left the coast of Ireland astern, and headed for
the barren shores of Greenland. Great numbers of
whales were encountered, and two of these sea monsters
dove underneath the ship, but did the craft no harm.
It was soon evident that there was a turbulent and
mutinous disposition among the crew,&mdash;Robert Juet,
the Mate, being the chief offender, for he had remarked
to one of the sailors that there would be bloodshed before
the voyage was over, and he was evidently plotting
to seize the vessel, even at this early date.</p>

<p>The history of this journey is very similar to that of
most of the Arctic explorers. Hudson and his men
met great, floating fields of ice; were chilled by the
perpetual frost and snow; and were finally starved into
a submissive recognition of the fact that there could
be no passage to Asia through the desolate region of the
frozen North.</p>

<p>Yet, the adventurous mariner discovered the great
bay which bears his name and also the strait which is
known as Hudson Strait. Forced to winter upon the
land near Cape Digges, he soon discovered that his food
supply was so low, that, should not succor come to him,
he and his men would die of starvation. Luckily, there
were many white partridges, or ptarmigan, near the
ship, which supplied them with provender, and, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Spring came, great numbers of swans, of geese, ducks
and other water-fowl came soaring by. Unfortunately
they went farther North to breed, so the poor explorers
were forced to search the hills, the woods, and the valleys
for anything which might afford them subsistence,
even eating the moss which grew upon the ground.</p>

<p>About the time when the ice began to break up, a
brown-skinned savage, doubtless an Eskimo, put in his
appearance, and, as he was treated well, returned in a
day or so, bringing beaver and other skins, which he
gave to Hudson and his men, in return for presents
which he had received the day before. He went away,
promising to visit them again, but, as he did not do so,
it is evident that he did not think that the white men
had given him good treatment.</p>

<p>The ice had now begun to melt, so the ship was
headed southward. It was the middle of June, yet
there were still great quantities of floating ice, so much,
in fact, that the vessel was obliged to anchor. The food
supply was about exhausted and all that was left was
a little bread and a few pounds of cheese. Hudson now
told one of the crew to search the chests of all of the
men in order to find any provisions which might be
concealed there. The sailor obeyed and brought the
Captain thirty cakes in a bag. When the crew learned
this, they were greatly exasperated, and plotted open
mutiny against the famous navigator.</p>

<p>The vessel had been detained about a week in the
ice when the first signs of mutiny appeared. Two
sailors, called Greene and Wilson, the latter being the
Boatswain, came one night to another mariner called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Pricket, and told him that several of the crew had resolved
to seize Hudson and set him adrift in a boat
with all those on board who had been disabled by sickness.</p>

<p>“There are only a few days’ provisions left,” said
Greene, “and the master seems to be entirely irresolute
which way to go. I, myself, have eaten nothing for
three days, so our only hope is to take command of the
ship, and, after escaping from these regions, we will go
back to England.”</p>

<p>Pricket remonstrated with them, saying: “If you
stain yourselves with so great a crime you will be banished
from England forever. Pray delay your intention
for four or five days, when we will be free of
the ice and can doubtless get plenty of fish in our
nets.”</p>

<p>Upon this Greene took up the Bible which lay there
and swore that he would “do no man harm, and that
what he did was for the good of the voyage and nothing
else.”</p>

<p>There were many poor fellows who were ill and it
was determined to maroon them in the boat with Hudson,
so that the mutineers could do as they wished with
the <i>Discovery</i>, and would not be hampered by either
their master or any one who could not work the ship.
It was decided to put the plot into execution at day-break.</p>

<p>As Hudson came up from the cabin, next morning,
after eating a scanty breakfast, he was immediately
seized by two sailors and his arms were bound fast
behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does this mean, men?” cried he, with great
indignation.</p>

<p>Only sneers of defiance greeted his question. He
now called upon the ship’s carpenter to help him, telling
him that he was bound, but, as this poor fellow was
also surrounded by mutineers, he could render him no
assistance.</p>

<p>The boat was now hauled alongside, and the sick
and the lame were made to come up from below. They
were told to get in, and Hudson’s little son was forced
to clamber over the steep sides of the vessel, and to lie
upon the bottom of the boat. The sails were now
hoisted upon the <i>Discovery</i>, and she stood eastward
with a fair wind, dragging the poor fellows in the boat,
astern. In a few hours, being clear of the ice, the
rope leading to the shallop was cut, and soon afterwards
the mutineers lost sight of Henry Hudson forever.</p>

<p>The hardy adventurer was never heard of again. As
for the mutineers, although they steered for Ireland,
before they reached the coast they were so weakened
that no one was found strong enough to stand by the
helm. When only one fowl was left for their subsistence
and another day would be their last, they abandoned
all care of the vessel and prepared to meet their
fate. Suddenly the joyful cry of “a sail” was heard,
and a fishing vessel came alongside which took them
into a harbor of Ireland. They arrived in London
after an absence of one year and five months.</p>

<p>The English people were horrified to learn of the
treatment which the mutinous crew had administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
to Henry Hudson and sent out two vessels, the next
Spring, in the hope of learning something of the fate
of this brave navigator. Yet nothing was ever seen
or heard of the unfortunate discoverer, who perished
amidst the fogs and the ice of that bleak, northern
ocean.</p>

<p>Hudson was brave, resourceful, and resolute. He
has been accused of cruelty to the Indians, and of want
of high principle in causing their general intoxication
when sailing upon the great river which was to be named
after him. Yet you must remember that he had a
mutinous body of men under his command, and could
not easily restrain them from returning insult for injury,
when their redskinned friends shot arrows at
them. The death of the nine Indians killed at the
head of Manhattan Island may be said to have been
caused in a war of self-defense. As for the charge of
heartlessness in getting the redskins intoxicated, you
must also remember, that, like his men, he was suspicious
and alarmed, and therefore was determined to
learn the honesty or treachery of the Indians by any
means whatsoever. In England, they grieved deeply
for the death of such a gallant countryman, and in the
new world he has perpetual monuments to his memory,
for here a great bay, a city, and a mighty river, all
bear the name of this brave yet unfortunate navigator.</p>

<p class="ppind">It sang of men of daring, and it whined of maids of the mist,</p>

<h2 class="p4">PIERRE ESPRIT RADISSON:</h2>

<p class="pch">FIRST EXPLORER OF THE WEST AND NORTHWEST.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1651-1710)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was at the trading post of Three Rivers on the St.
Lawrence River, the year 1662, and the time, early
in the morning, when the wood thrush had just
begun his call. Strange things happened then, but these
were frontier days when strange things used to happen,
so do not be surprised when you learn what befell Pierre
Radisson, son of a French emigrant to Canada, and
then a youth of about seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>With two companions, young Pierre had gone out
from the stockade to shoot ducks on Lake St. Peter, not
far from this first home of the French emigrants to
Canada.</p>

<p>The sportsmen were all young, for only young boys
would have left the shelter of the fortification at this
time, as all the Canadians knew that the dreaded Iroquois
had been lying in ambush around the little settlement
of Three Rivers, day and night, for a whole year.
In fact, not a week passed but that some settler was
set upon in the fields and left dead by the terrible redskins.
Farmers had flocked to the little fortification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and would only venture back to their broad acres when
armed with a musket.</p>

<p>But these were only boys, and, like all boys, they went
along, boasting how they would fight when the Indians
came. One kept near the edge of the forest, on the
lookout for the Iroquois, while the others kept to the
water in quest of game. They had gone along in this
manner for about three miles, when they met a fellow
who was tending sheep.</p>

<p>“Keep out from the foot of the hills!” he called to
them. “The Iroquois are there! I saw about a hundred
heads rising out of the bushes about an hour ago.”</p>

<p>The boys loaded their pistols and primed their muskets.</p>

<p>In a short time they shot some ducks, and this seemed
to satisfy one of the young men.</p>

<p>“I have had enough,” said he. “I am going back
to the stockade where I can be safe.”</p>

<p>“And I will go with you,” said the second.</p>

<p>But young Radisson laughed at them.</p>

<p>“If you are afraid to go forward,” said he, “I will
go ahead by myself.”</p>

<p>So the wild youth went onward, shooting game at
many places, until, at length, he had a large number
of geese, ducks, and teal. There were more than he
could possibly carry, so, hiding in a hollow tree the
game that he could not bring back, he began trudging
towards Three Rivers. Wading swollen brooks and
scrambling over fallen trees, he finally caught sight of
the town chapel, glimmering in the sunlight against the
darkening horizon above the river. He had reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
place where his comrades had left him, so he sat down
to rest himself.</p>

<p>The shepherd had driven his sheep back to Three
Rivers and there was no one near. The river came
lapping through the rushes. There was a clacking of
ducks as they came swooping down to their marsh nests
and Radisson felt strangely lonely. He noticed, too,
that his pistols were water-soaked. Emptying the
charges, he re-loaded, then crept back to reconnoiter the
woodland. Great flocks of ducks were swimming on
the river, so he determined to have one more shot before
he returned to the fort, now within easy hail.</p>

<p>Young Pierre crept through the grass towards the
game, but he suddenly stopped, for, before him was a
sight that rooted him to the ground with horror. Just
as they had fallen, naked and scalped, with bullet and
hatchet wounds all over their bodies, lay his comrades
of the morning. They were stone dead, lying face upward
among the rushes.</p>

<p>Radisson was too far away from the woods to get
back to them, so, stooping down, he tried to reach a
hiding place in the marsh. As he bent over, half a
hundred tufted heads rose from the high grass, and
beady eyes looked to see which way he might go. They
were behind him, before him, on all sides of him,&mdash;his
only hope was a dash for the cane-grown river, where
he might hide himself until darkness would give him a
chance to rush to the fort.</p>

<p>Slipping a bullet and some powder into his musket
as he ran, and ramming it down, young Pierre dashed
through the brushwood for a place of safety. <i>Crash!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
A score of guns roared from the forest. He turned, and
fired back, but; before he could re-load, an Iroquois
brave was upon him, he was thrown upon his back, was
disarmed, his hands were bound behind him with deer
thongs, and he was dragged into the woods, where the
Indians flaunted the scalps of his friends before his
eyes. Half drawn, half driven, he was taken to the
shore where a flotilla of canoes was hidden. Fires were
kindled, and, upon forked sticks driven into the ground,
the redskins boiled a kettle of water for the evening
meal.</p>

<p>The Iroquois admired bravery in any man, and they
now evinced a certain affection for this young Frenchman,
for, in defiance of danger, they had seen him go
hunting alone. When attacked, he had fired back
at enough enemies to have terrified any ordinary
Canadian. This they liked, so his clothing was returned
to him, they daubed his cheeks with war paint,
shaved his head in the manner of the redskinned braves,
and, when they saw that their stewed dog turned him
faint, they boiled him some meat in clean water and
gave him some meal, browned upon burning sand.
That night he slept beneath a blanket, between two
warriors.</p>

<p>In the morning the Indians embarked in thirty-seven
canoes, two redskins in each boat, with young
Pierre tied to a cross-bar in one of them. Spreading
out on the river, they beat their paddles upon the gunwales
of their bateaux, shot off their guns, and uttered
their shrill war cry,&mdash;“Ah-oh! Ah-oh! Ah-oh!”</p>

<p>The echoes carried along the wailing call, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
log stockade the Canadians looked furtively at one another
as the horrid sound was borne to them by the
gentle wind. Then the chief stood up in his canoe,
signaled silence, and gave three long blood-curdling
yells. The whole company answered with a quavering
chorus like wolf barks, and, firing their guns into the
air, the canoes were driven out into the river, past the
nestling log-stockade of Three Rivers, and up the current
of the rushing stream. By sunset they were
among the islands at the mouth of the river Richelieu,
where were great clouds of wild-ducks, which darkened
the air at their approach.</p>

<p>Young Pierre bore up bravely, determined to remain
with his captors until an opportunity to escape presented
itself. The red men treated him kindly, saying:
“<i>Chagon! Chagon!</i> Be merry! Cheer up!”
He was given a paddle and was told to row, which he
did right willingly. Another band of warriors was
met with on the river, and the prisoner was forced to
show himself as a trophy of victory and to sing songs
for his captors, which he did to the best of his ability.
That evening an enormous camp-fire was kindled and
the united bands danced a scalp-dance around it, flaunting
the scalps of the two dead French boys from spear
heads, and reënacted in pantomime all the episodes of
the massacre, while the women beat on rude, Indian
drums.</p>

<p>Pierre was now a thorough savage. He was given
a tin looking-glass by which the Indians used to signal
by the sun, and also a hunting knife. The Iroquois
neared Lake Champlain where the river became so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
turbulent that they were forced to land and make a
portage. Young Radisson hurried over the rocks,
helping the older warriors to carry their packs. As
night came on, he was the first to cut wood for the
camp-fire.</p>

<p>It was now about a week since the redmen had left
Lake St. Peter and they entered the gray waste of
Lake Champlain. Paddling down its entire length,
they entered the waters of beautiful Lake George, and,
beaching the canoes upon its western bank, abandoned
them: the warriors striking out through the forest for
the country of the Iroquois. For two days they thus
journeyed from the lake, when they were met by several
women, who loaded themselves down with the luggage
of the party, and accompanied the victorious braves to
the village. Here the whole tribe marched out to meet
them, singing, firing guns, shouting a welcome, dancing
a war-dance of joy.</p>

<p>It was now time for young Pierre to run the gauntlet.
Sometimes the white prisoners were slowly led along
with trussed arms and shackled feet, so that they could
not fail to be killed before they reached the end of the
line. With Radisson it was different. He was
stripped free and was told to run so fast that his tormentors
could not hit him. He did this and reached
the end of the human lane unscathed.</p>

<p>As the white boy dashed free of the line of his tormentors,
a captive Huron woman, who had been
adopted by the tribe, caught him and led him to her
cabin, where she fed and clothed him. But soon a
band of braves marched to her door, demanded his surrender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and took him to the Council Lodge of the Iroquois
for judgment.</p>

<p>Radisson was led into a huge cabin, where several
old men sat solemnly around a central fire, smoking
their calumets, or peace pipes. He was ordered to sit
down. A coal of fire was then put into the bowl of the
great Council Pipe and it was passed reverently around
the assemblage. The old Huron woman now entered,
waved her arms aloft, and begged for the life of the
young man. As she made her appeal, the old men
smoked on silently with deep, guttural “ho-ho’s”
meaning “Yes&mdash;yes. We are much pleased.” So
she was granted permission to adopt Radisson as a son.
The nerve and courage of the young French boy had
thus saved his life. He must bide his time,&mdash;bye and
bye, he would have an opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>It was soon Autumn, the period of the hunt, so
young Pierre set out into the forest with three savages
in order to lay in a supply of meat for the winter
months. One night, as the woodland rovers were returning
to their wigwams, there came the sound of
some one singing through the leafy thicket, and a man
approached. He was an Algonquin brave, a captive
among the Iroquois, and he told them that he had been
on the track of bear since day-break. He was welcomed
to the camp-fire, and, when he learned that
Radisson was from Three Rivers, he immediately grew
friendly with the captive white boy.</p>

<p>That evening, when the camp-fire was roaring and
crackling so that the Iroquois could not hear what he
said, the Indian told Radisson that he had been a captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
for two years and that he longed to make his
escape.</p>

<p>“Hist! Boy!” said he. “Do you love the
French?”</p>

<p>Pierre looked around cautiously.</p>

<p>“Do you love the Algonquins?” he replied.</p>

<p>“As I do my own mother,” was the answer. Then,
leaning closer, the warrior whispered: “Brother&mdash;white
man&mdash;let us escape! The Three Rivers, it is
not so far off! Will you live like a dog in bondage, or
will you have your liberty with the French?” Then
he lowered his voice. “Let us kill all three of these
hounds to-night, when they are asleep, and then let us
paddle away, up Lake Champlain, again to the country
of our own people.”</p>

<p>Radisson’s face grew pale beneath his war paint.
He hesitated to answer, and, as he looked about him,
the suspicious Iroquois cried out:</p>

<p>“Why so much whispering?”</p>

<p>“We are telling hunting stories,” answered the Algonquin,
smiling.</p>

<p>This seemed to satisfy the Iroquois, for, wearied by
the day’s hunt, they soon dozed off in sleep and were
snoring heavily: their feet to the glowing embers.
Their guns were stacked carelessly against a tree. It
was the time for action.</p>

<p>The French boy was terrified lest the Algonquin
should carry out his threat, and so pretended to be
asleep. Rising noiselessly, the captive redskin crept
up to the fire and eyed the three sleeping Mohawks
with no kindly glance. The redmen slept heavily on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
while the cry of a whip-poor-will sounded ominously
from the black and gloomy forest.</p>

<p>The crafty Algonquin stepped, like a cat, over the
sleeping forms of the braves, took possession of their
firearms, and then walked to where Radisson was lying.
The French boy rose uneasily. As he did so, the Indian
thrust a tomahawk into one of his hands, pointing,
with a menacing gesture, to the three Iroquois. Radisson’s
hand shook like a leaf.</p>

<p>But the captive red man’s hand did not shake, and,
lifting his own hatchet, he had brained one of the sleeping
redskins without more ado. Pierre endeavored to
imitate the warrior, but, unnerved with the horror of
it all, he lost hold of his tomahawk, just as it struck the
head of the sleeping Iroquois. The redskin leaped to
his feet, uttering a wild yell, which awakened the third
sleeper. But he had no chance to rise, as the Algonquin
felled him with one, swift blow, while Radisson,
recovering his hatchet, hit the second red man with
such force, that he fell back, lifeless.</p>

<p>Hurray! Radisson was free!</p>

<p>The Algonquin did not waste precious moments;
but, hastily scalping the dead, he threw their bodies
into the river, then, packing up all their possessions,
they placed them in the canoe, took to the water, and
slipped away towards Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>“I was sorry to have been in such an encounter,”
writes Radisson. “But it was too late to repent.”</p>

<p>The fugitives were a long way from Three Rivers,
on the St. Lawrence, and they knew that many roving
Iroquois were hunting in the country between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and the French settlement. They must go carefully,
be perpetually on their guard, and then,&mdash;they would
be among their own people again! Only, caution!
caution! And never a sound at any time!</p>

<p>Traveling only at night, and hiding during the day,
the fugitives crossed Lake Champlain, entered the
Richelieu, and, after many portages, finally swept out
upon the wide surface of Lake St. Peter, in the St.
Lawrence. They paddled hard and were soon within a
day’s journey of Three Rivers, yet they were in greater
danger then than at any time in the hazardous trip, as
the Iroquois had infested this part of the St. Lawrence
for more than a year, and often lay hidden in the rush-grown
marshes and the wooded islands, waiting for
some unsuspecting French Canadian to pass by. It
was four o’clock in the morning when the Algonquin
and white boy reached the side of Lake St. Peter.
They cooked their breakfast, covered the fire, and lay
down to sleep.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, the Algonquin shook Pierre by the
shoulder, urging him to cross the lake to the Three
Rivers side.</p>

<p>“The Iroquois are lurking about here,” the French
boy answered. “I am afraid to go. Let us wait until
dark. Then, all will be well.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered the brave. “Let us paddle
forward. We are past fear. Let us shake off the yoke
of these whelps who have killed so many French and
black robes (priests). If you do not come now, I will
leave you, and I will tell the Governor that you were
afraid to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>Radisson consented to take a chance at getting to the
stockade, although his judgment told him to wait until
dark. So the canoe was pushed out from the rushes,
and, with strong strokes, the flimsy boat was driven towards
the north shore. They were half way across,
when Pierre called out: “I see shadows on the water
ahead.”</p>

<p>The Indian, who was in the stern, stood up, saying:</p>

<p>“It is but the shadow of a flying bird. There is no
danger.”</p>

<p>So they kept on; but, as they progressed, the shadows
multiplied, for they were the reflections of many Iroquois,
hidden among the rushes. The fugitives now
saw them, and, heading their canoe for the south shore,
fled for their lives.</p>

<p>On, on they went; but, on, on, came the Iroquois.
The redskins came nearer and nearer, there was a
crash of musketry and the bottom of the canoe was
punctured by a ball. The Algonquin fell dead with
two bullet wounds in his head, while the canoe gradually
filled with water, settled, and sank, with the young
Frenchman clinging to the side. Now a firm hand
seized him, and he was hauled into one of the canoes of
the Iroquois.</p>

<p>The victors set up a shrill yelp of triumph. Then
they went ashore, kindled a great fire, tore the heart
out of the dead Algonquin, put his head on a pike, and
cast the mutilated body into the flames. Radisson was
bound, roped around the waist, and thrown down upon
the ground, where he lay with other captives: two
Frenchmen, one white woman, and twenty Hurons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>In seventeen canoes, the Iroquois now paddled up
the Richelieu River for their own country, frequently
landing to camp and cook, at which times young Pierre
was pegged out on the sand, and left to be tortured
by sand-flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>When they reached the village, Radisson was greeted
with shouts of rage by the friends of the murdered
Mohawks, who, armed with rods and skull-crackers
(leather bags loaded with stones) rushed upon him
and beat him sorely. As the prisoners moved on,
the Hurons wailed the death dirge. But suddenly
there broke from the throng of onlookers the
Iroquois family that had adopted young Pierre.
Pushing through the crowd of torturers, the mother
caught Radisson by the hair, crying out: “Orimba!
Orimba!” She then cut the thongs that bound him
to the poles, and shoved him to her husband, who
led the trembling young Frenchman to their own
lodge.</p>

<p>“Thou fool,” cried the old chief, turning wrathfully
upon the young man. “Thou wast my son! Thou
lovest us not, although we saved thy life! Wouldst
kill me, too?” Then he shoved him to a mat upon
the ground, saying: “<i>Chagon</i>&mdash;now be merry! It
is a fine business you’ve gotten yourself into, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>Radisson sank to the ground, trembling with fear,
and endeavored to eat something. He was relating his
adventures when there was a roar of anger from the
Iroquois outside, and, a moment later, the rabble broke
into the lodge. He was seized, carried back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
other prisoners, and turned over to the torture. We
will draw a veil over what now befell him.</p>

<p>After three days of misery the half-dead Frenchman
was brought before the council of the Mohawk Chiefs.
Sachem after sachem rose and spoke, while tobacco was
sacrificed to the fire-god. The question to be decided
was, could the Mohawks afford to offend the great Iroquois
chief who was the French youth’s friend? This
chieftain wished to have the young man’s life spared.
Would they do so?</p>

<p>After much talk and passing of the peace-pipe, it was
decided that the young man could go free. The captive’s
bonds were cut, he was allowed to leave the council
chamber, and, although unable to walk, was carried
to the lodge of his deliverer. For the second time his
life had been saved.</p>

<p>Spring came at last and the young Frenchman was
taken on a raid amidst the enemies of the Iroquois.
Then they went on a free-booting expedition against
the whites of the Dutch settlements at Orange (Albany),
which consisted, at that time, of some fifty
thatched log-houses surrounded by the settlements of
one hundred and fifty farmers. The raid was a bloodless
one, the red warriors looting the farmers’ cabins,
emptying their cupboards, and drinking up all the beer
in their cellars. Finally they all became intoxicated,
and, as they wanted guns, the Dutch easily took advantage
of them in trade.</p>

<p>Radisson had been painted like a Mohawk and was
dressed in buckskin. For the first time in two years
he saw white men, and, although he could not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the Dutch language, it gave him great pleasure to
see some one of his own race again.</p>

<p>As the white Mohawk moved about the fort, he noticed
a soldier among the Dutch who was a Frenchman,
and, at the same instant the soldier saw, that, beneath
all the paint and grease, was a brother. They spoke
to each other, threw their arms around one another’s
necks, and from that moment Radisson became the lion
of Fort Orange.</p>

<p>The Dutch people crowded about him, shook his
hand, offered him presents of wine and of money. They
wished to ransom him at any price; but he was pledged
to return to his Indian parents and he feared the revenge
of the Mohawk braves. So he had to decline
the kind offer of the white men, returning to his lodge
in the Indian country, far more of a hero in the eyes
of his Indian allies than ever before.</p>

<p>Young Pierre had not been back among the Iroquois
for more than two weeks when he began to pine
for the log fortress at Three Rivers. He loathed
the filthy food, the smoky lodges, the cruelties of the
Mohawks, and he longed to be once more among his
own people. Hidden beneath all the grease and war
paint was the true nature of the white man, and he
determined to escape, even if he had to die for the
attempt.</p>

<p>The white Indian left his lodge, early one morning
in the month of September, taking only his hatchet,
as if he were going to cut wood. Once out of sight of
the Mohawk village, he broke into a run, following the
trail, through the dense forests of the Mohawk Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
towards Fort Orange. On, on, he ran until the morning,
when, spent with fatigue, he fell exhausted to the
ground. After a short sleep, he again arose, pressed
forward through the brush, and finally came to a clearing
in the forest where a man was chopping wood. He
found that there were no redskins in the cabin, then,
hiding in it, he persuaded the settler to carry a message
to the Fort. While he was absent, he hid behind
some sacks of wheat.</p>

<p>The frontiersman had been gone about an hour, when
he returned with a rescue party, which conducted the
young Frenchman to the Fort. Here he hid for three
days, while a mob of Mohawks wandered through the
stockade, calling for him by name, but they could not
find him. Gifts of money from a Jesuit priest enabled
him to take a ship to New York, then a settlement
of five hundred houses, with stores, barracks, and
a stone church. After a stay of three weeks the ex-Mohawk
set sail for Amsterdam, where he arrived in
January, 1674.</p>

<p>He took a ship for Rochelle, but alas! he there found
that all of his relatives had moved to Three Rivers in
New France. Why remain here? In a week’s time
he had embarked with the fishing fleet which yearly left
France for the Great Banks, and came, early in the
Spring of 1675, to Isle Percée, at the mouth of the
St. Lawrence. He was a week’s journey from Three
Rivers, but Algonquin canoes were on their way up the
blue St. Lawrence for a fight with the Iroquois. He
jumped into one of them, and, in a very short time,
once more sprang ashore at the stockade of Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Rivers where he was welcomed as one risen from the
dead.</p>

<p>Not long after this, we find Radisson at the stockade
of Onondaga, a French fort built upon a hill above a
lake upon the Oswego River. Here the French had
established a post, the farthest in the wilderness; and
here about sixty Frenchmen were spending the winter,
waiting for the Spring to break up the ice so that they
could return to Quebec. The redskins seemed to be
friendly; but, early in February, vague rumors of a
conspiracy against them came to the ears of the white
men. A dying Mohawk confessed to a Jesuit priest
that the Iroquois Council had decided to massacre half
the garrison, and to hold the other half captive until
their own Mohawk hostages were released from Quebec.
These were held there by the French to ensure good
treatment of their own people at this far-distant
fortress.</p>

<p>What were the French to do? Here they were,
miles and miles from Three Rivers, surrounded by hostiles,
with Winter at hand. How could they escape?
Radisson was quite equal to the emergency and proposed
a way to outwit the savages, which was as cunning
as it was amusing. He would invite all of the
braves to a big feast, he would get them stupefied with
food and with drink, then, when all were asleep, the
sixty Frenchmen would take to their boats and would
make a break for it down the river. A bold idea&mdash;this.
Let us see how it worked out?</p>

<p>Radisson told the redskins that he had had a “big
dream,” a dream to the effect that the white men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to give a great feast to the Iroquois. They greeted the
news with joy, and, as couriers ran through the forest,
bidding the Mohawks to the banquet, the warriors
hastened to the walls of Onondaga. To sharpen their
appetites, they were kept waiting outside for two whole
days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside the fort everything was made
ready for a hasty departure. Ammunition was scattered
in the snow; guns which could not be taken along
were either burned or broken; canoes were prepared
to be launched; all the live stock, except one solitary
pig, a few chickens, and the dogs, was sacrificed for the
feast. The soldiers cooked great kettles of meat and
kept the redskins from peering into the stockade, lest
they discover what was going on.</p>

<p>The evening of the second day arrived, and a great
fire was kindled in the outer inclosure of the fort, between
the two walls, where blankets were spread for
the redskinned guests. Now the trumpets blew a deafening
blast, the Mohawks shouted, and the French
clapped their hands wildly. As the outer gates were
thrown open, in trooped several hundred Mohawk warriors,
who seated themselves in a circle around the fire,
saying:</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh! We much hungry!”</p>

<p>Again the trumpets blared, and twelve enormous
kettles of mince-meat were carried around the circle
of guests. All dipped deeply into the steaming
dish, while one Mohawk chieftain arose solemnly, saying:</p>

<p>“The French are the most generous people on earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
The Great Spirit has indeed blessed the French, to
make them so kind to the Mohawks. We are truly
glad to be at the feast with our white brothers.”</p>

<p>Other speakers arose, proclaiming the great virtues
of the French; but, before they had finished talking,
there came a second and a third relay of kettles. Here
were plates of salted fowl, of venison, and of bear.
The Indians gorged themselves, each looking at his
neighbor to see if he could still eat.</p>

<p>“Cheer up! Cheer up!” cried Radisson, as he
circled among the braves. “If sleep overcomes you,
you must awake! Cheer up! Cheer up! Beat the
drum! Blow the trumpet! Cheer up!”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Indians began to roll, for never before
had they had such a banquet. Some shook their
heads and lolled backwards, others fell over in the dead
sleep which comes from long fasting, fresh air and
overfeeding. By midnight all were sprawled upon the
ground in deep slumber. The moment for action was
at hand.</p>

<p>The French retired to the inner court, while the main
gate was bolted and chained. The Indians were all
outside the French quarters, so they could not see what
was going on inside, even if they had been awake.
Through the loop-hole of the gate ran a rope attached
to a bell which was used to summon the sentry, and to
this rope Radisson tied the only remaining pig, so
that, when the Indians would pull the rope for admission,
the noise of the disturbed porker would give the
impression of a sentry’s <i>tramp, tramp</i> on parade.
Stuffed soldiers were placed around the palisades, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that, if an Indian should climb up to look into the fort,
he would still see Frenchmen there.</p>

<p>The baggage was now stowed away in flat boats, and
dugouts were brought out for the rest of the company.
The night was raw and cold, while a thin sheeting of ice
had formed upon the margin of the river. The fugitives
were soon on board their craft, had pushed out
into the stream, and were off; while, behind them, the
redskins still lay around in a circle of stupid insensibility.
Only the barking of a dog disturbed the quiet
of the evening.</p>

<p>Piloted by the crafty Radisson, the French left Onondago
on the 20th. day of March, 1678. On the evening
of April 3d. they came to Montreal, where they
learned that New France had suffered intolerable
insolence from the Iroquois all winter. On the 23d.,
they moored safely under the walls of the citadel
of Quebec, where all laughed heartily at the good
trick which they had worked upon the bloodthirsty Mohawks.</p>

<p>When Spring came and canoes could venture up the
river, couriers brought word that the Mohawks at Onondago
had been greatly deceived by the pig and the
ringing bell. The stuffed figures had led them to believe
that the French were there, for more than a
week. Crowing of cocks had come from the chicken
yard, dogs had bayed in the kennels, and whenever a
curious brave had yanked the bell at the gate, he could
hear the measured march of the sentry.</p>

<p>When seven days passed by, and not a white man
came from the fort:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>“The black robes must be at prayers,” whispered the
Mohawks.</p>

<p>But they could not pray on for seven days. Suspicions
of trickery flashed on the minds of the Iroquois,
and a warrior climbed to the top of the palisade.
It was empty, and the French had gone!</p>

<p>Two hundred Mohawks immediately set out in pursuit,
but there was much ice and snow, so that they had
to return, cursing their stupidity, and the cleverness
of Pierre Radisson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Radisson did more than this, he discovered the Great
Northwest. When a captive among the Mohawks, he
had cherished boyish dreams of discovering many wild
nations; and, when his brother-in-law, Groseillers, asked
him to take a journey with him far to the westward,
he only too readily acquiesced. Late one night in
June, Groseillers and he stole out from Three Rivers,
accompanied by Algonquin guides. They went as far
as Green Bay, spent the winter there, then, when the
Spring sun warmed the land, they traveled westward,
passed across what is now the State of Wisconsin, and
reached a “mighty river rushing profound and comparable
to the St. Lawrence.” It was the upper Mississippi,
now seen for the first time by white men.</p>

<p>The Spring of 1679 found the explorers still among
the prairie tribes of the Mississippi, and from them
Radisson learned of the Sioux, a warlike nation to the
West, who had no fixed abode, but lived by the chase
and were at constant war with another tribe to the
north, the Crees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The two Frenchmen pressed westward, circled over
the territory now known as Wisconsin, eastern Iowa
and Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana, and back
over North Dakota and Minnesota to the north shore
of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Then Radisson made a snow-shoe trip towards Hudson’s
Bay and back again, living on moose meat and the
flesh of beaver and caribou. Finally, after adventures
exciting and hair-raising, he and Groseillers found their
way to Three Rivers.</p>

<p>Although Radisson was not yet twenty-eight years of
age, his explorations into the Great Northwest had won
him both fame and fortune.</p>

<p>So this is the way that he spent his life. Voyaging,
trapping, trading, he covered all this great, wild country,
paddled up her rivers, fished in her lakes, smoked
the pipe of peace in her settlements. In ten years’
time he brought half a million dollars’ worth of furs to
an English trading company which employed him.</p>

<p>Yet, with all his explorations, all his adventures, all
his trading, as he grew old, he remained as poor as one
of the <i>couriers de bois</i> who used to paddle him up the
streams of New France. Until the year 1710 he drew
an allowance of £50 a year ($250) from the English
Hudson Bay Trading Company, then payments seemed
to have stopped. Radisson had a wife and four children
to support, but what happened to him, or to them,
is unknown to history.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the vast country of New France the
life of this daring adventurer went out. And somewhere
in that vast possession lies the body of this, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
first white man to explore the Great Northwest. Oblivion
hides all record of his death, and only the cry
of the moose-bird, harsh, discordant&mdash;the true call of
the wilderness&mdash;echoes over the unknown spot where
lie, no doubt, the bones of this trickster of the Mohawks
and explorer of the wastes of New France.</p>

<p>Memorial tablets have been erected in many cities to
commemorate La Salle, Champlain, and other discoverers.
Radisson has no monument, save the memory
of a valiant man-of-the-woods, reverently held in the
hearts of all those who love the hemlock forests, the
paddle, the pack, and the magnetic call of the wilderness.</p>

<h2 class="p4">FATHER MARQUETTE:</h2>

<p class="pch">TRUE MAN OE GOD, AND EXPLORER OF<br />
THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1637-1675)</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">MANY, many years ago, when the Indian tribes
inhabited the wilderness of North America,
a good priest came among them to teach them
the ways of Christ. He was a Frenchman called Père,
or Father Marquette, and he had been born at Laon,
France, June 1st., 1627.</p>

<p>Early choosing the profession of priesthood, he entered
the Jesuit College at Nancy, where he finally
graduated, a man of saintly character, accurate learning
and distinguished culture. Yet, disdaining to remain
in France, he eagerly looked forward to adventure
in the wilderness of North America, and was consequently
overjoyed to receive an order to proceed to
Canada, then termed New France. He set sail, arrived
at the struggling village of Quebec, September
20th., 1666, and, in October of that same year, was
sent to Three Rivers, to begin the study of the Indian
language and to obtain some knowledge of the life of a
missionary.</p>

<p>Some of you have doubtless camped in the Canadian
wilderness, where you have seen the Indians, trappers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and guides, who hover around the outfitter’s store,
where one buys his food for a canoe trip into the woods.
The Canadian wilderness, then, was much wilder than
it is now. In those days there were thousands of redskins,
where now there are only a few, and in those
days the red men were really ferocious, often engaging
in great battles with each other, and torturing their
prisoners with fire-brands and also making them run
the gauntlet.</p>

<p>The French were very kind to the redskins and sent
many Jesuit missionaries among them, so the red men
liked the Frenchmen, even as they disliked the English.
The Englishmen treated them like some inferior sort
of dogs, whereas the French priests endeavored to help
them in every way possible; taught them medicine,
cooking and house-building, and looked after them
when they were ill.</p>

<p>Father Marquette was accustomed to the refinement
and culture of the France of his day, so it must have
been a curious experience for him to be suddenly
thrown into the wilderness life. Yet he settled down
to his career of a missionary with zeal and enthusiasm,
taking up a residence with one Father Drulettes, who
lived in a log hut. Here he spent two years of hard
study and still harder life, eagerly learning woodcraft,
canoeing and the Indian language, which was to be of
great assistance to him in later years.</p>

<p>Time passed pleasantly by. Finally it was agreed
that young Father Marquette knew sufficient “Indian
talk” to make himself understood by the redskins, so,
in April, 1668, he was sent forth among the Ottawas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
With several others he left Three Rivers for Montreal,
traveling by canoe, and from this small settlement
journeyed to the Sault de Sainte Marie, a trading post
built where the waters of Lake Superior rush tumultuously
through boiling rapids towards Lake Huron.
Here was the mission of St. Mary, the headquarters of
the Jesuit fathers who labored among the Ottawa Indians.
Here also were many white fur traders, who
wished to barter with the red men.</p>

<p>The Indians were many. The Ottawa tribe consisted
of the Chippewas, Beavers, Creeks, Ottawas,
Hurons, Menomonees, Pottawattomies, Sacs, Foxes,
Winnebagoes, Miamis, Illinois and the Sioux. The
natives lived along the shores of Lake Superior, Lake
Huron, and through the woods of Michigan and Wisconsin,
near the banks of the many rivers in this region.</p>

<p>The “Soo” or Sault Ste. Marie is a busy place to-day,
and it was a busy place then, for it was the heart
of all Indian activity, being the place from which all
the redskins set out upon their trips to the wilderness
and to Quebec and Montreal. Now the great locks
make continuous travel by water possible between Buffalo
and Detroit. In our times as many ships pass this
point as did birch-bark canoes in the year of 1600.
Yet then, there was as much trade and barter at the
“Soo,” in comparison to the Indian and white population,
as there is now, with the vast population which
surrounds it.</p>

<p>Father Marquette enjoyed himself greatly among the
redskins, and particularly loved the long canoe trips
in the beautiful rivers and lakes. He was much respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
by the Indians, who called him, “the good
brother,” and so successful was he in converting them
to Christianity that he was sent from Mission Sault Ste.
Marie to Mission La Pointe, on Lake Superior, where
he arrived in September, 1669. Here he labored
among the peaceful red men until the post was abandoned
in 1671, because the warlike Sioux had determined
to fight with the Hurons.</p>

<p>For the poor Hurons to accept the gauge of battle
would have meant their utter destruction, so they fled
to the south, taking up their residence at Michillimackinac,
on Lake Huron. Thither went the noble Father
Marquette, and, seated among them in his black robe,
took part in all their many deliberations. He baptized
their children, married their young braves, and taught
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Here he established the
Mission St. Ignace and built a beautiful chapel, to
which, years later, worn out and exhausted by his serious
labors in the wilderness, his body was carried by
the redskins for burial.</p>

<p>As the good priest lived among the red men, he heard
stories of a great river which lay to the westward, so
he determined to discover and explore it. Wandering
trappers brought him news of this stream, and, as he
now knew how to talk with these wild men of the north,
he easily learned all that they could tell him about it.
His heart and mind were stirred with the fever of the
adventurer. He <i>must</i>, he <i>would</i> go and see what lay
far to the westward where were ferocious redskins, wild
beasts, and unknown water-courses.</p>

<p>As dreams of exploration floated through the pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and boyish mind of the good Jesuit missionary, a
Frenchman, called Joliet, arrived from Quebec. Ah,
but he was a roving dog, this Joliet, and, when he
heard that the priest was contemplating a trip of exploration
and adventure, up went his hands, a smile
came to his face, and he exclaimed, “Oh, my good
Father Marquette, I am the man to go with you! I,
and I alone, shall be your companion in this venture
into the wilderness. Here’s my hand upon it!”</p>

<p>So the two adventurers clasped hands, then set about
to secure five stout canoemen with backwoods experience,
to paddle with them to the great unknown. It
was not difficult to find such fellows (<i>couriers de bois</i>,
they were called).</p>

<p>On May 17th., 1673, Marquette and Joliet, with five
as staunch Frenchmen as ever lifted a pack and poled
a canoe, started upon an ever-memorable journey of
exploration. They went in but two canoes&mdash;big
birch-bark fellows to be sure&mdash;and carried with them
guns, clothing, food, robes, books, and scientific instruments.
’Twas a good load to stow away in such small
bateaux, but they must have been larger canoes than
we use to-day, where only three can comfortably travel.
There were two brave men at the head of this expedition;
they loved God; they loved France, and they
strove to do something for God and Fatherland. They
succeeded in both.</p>

<p>From the little mission of St. Ignace the party of explorers
followed the right shore of Lake Michigan in a
westerly and southerly direction. They first stopped
at Green Bay, where they visited the tribe of Menomonees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
so called after the wild rice which there grew luxuriously
in the rich mud bottoms and swamplands.
The red men were very hospitable and begged the good
priest in his black robe not to proceed farther. “You
will meet a nation which never shows mercy to strangers,”
said one chieftain. “They will break your
heads with their stone hatchets. The great river which
you look for is very dangerous. It is full of horrible
monsters which will devour your canoes. There is a
big Demon in the path which swallows all who approach
him, and the heat is so great that you will all die.”</p>

<p>To this the Jesuit missionary replied,</p>

<p>“I do not fear these things, my red brothers. My
God is with me and he will protect me from all these
demons.”</p>

<p>So the voyagers bade the doubting redskins good-bye,
turned the bows of their canoes towards the setting sun,
and went forth upon their journey.</p>

<p>The paddles drove the light birch-bark boats along
the shore of Lake Michigan. Many times the voyagers
gazed at the magnificent scenery with rapt attention,
for they were in the heart of the wilderness, and, as
lovers of nature, they enjoyed the magnificence of
wooded shore-line and wave-tossed water. On, on, they
went, passing from Green Bay to the southern end, and
down this into Lake Winnebago: blue, forest-hidden,
and shimmering in the rays of the brilliant sunlight.</p>

<p>At the end of this beautiful sheet of water was an
Indian village, where now is the town of Oshkosh.
Here were many redskins, Mascoutens, Miamis and
Kickapoos, some of whom had migrated thither from
Virginia and Ohio. Pere Marquette was greeted hospitably,
for many of these Indians were Christians and
had erected a handsome cross in the center of their
town, adorned with skins of the fox and the beaver,
with red belts, bows and arrows, all offerings to the
Great Manitou, or God of all Gods.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The wandering priest conducted religious services,
then asked his hearers for two guides to pilot them to
the mighty river, which he heard was to the westward.
Joyfully the red men gave him two Miami braves, who,
leading him to the branches of the upper Fox, showed
him where to take to the land and portage across country
to the head-waters of the <i>Weskonsing</i>, now the Wisconsin
River. The birch-bark boats were soon floating
past virgin forests, in which robins and cat-birds caroled
songs of welcome to these, the first white men
who had ever sailed past upon the surface of the stream,
The Miami guides now departed and the adventurers
went forward alone.</p>

<p>For seven days the paddles drove the shallow canoes
down the slow-moving Wisconsin, and then, upon the
morning of the eighth day, the waters widened and the
<i>couriers de bois</i> with their venturesome man-of-God
suddenly paddled into the muddied current of the
mighty <i>Missi-sepi</i>, or Great River. It was a point
where the Father of Waters was a mile across and was
fifty-three feet deep, so, as Pere Marquette gazed upon
the turbid current, he had “a joy which he could not
express.” For days he had journeyed westward to
view the fabled river, and now he saw that wonderful
stream of which the wandering fur traders and redskins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
had told him at the far distant mission of St. Ignace.</p>

<p>It was the tenth of June. Marquette had left
the quiet mission on May the seventeenth, nearly a
month before this; the journey, so far, had been pleasant,
but what lay beyond? Hostile Indians, fever,
treacherous currents, death in the stream and death
upon the shore! Yet, on, on, went Pere Marquette
until he had reached the mouth of the Arkansas. Here
he halted, for he believed that he was within three days’
journey of the ocean. The good priest was feverish,
for the malarial mosquito hovered over the yellow current
of the Mississippi then, even as he does now. Yet,
what cared he? His work had been well done and he
had added much to the glory of France and to the renown
of the Jesuit brotherhood.</p>

<p>Again and again, as they descended the stream, the
canoes had struck the backs of monster fish, the sturgeons,
which looked and felt like great tree trunks in
the water. The boatmen had landed, every day, and
had shot wild turkeys, ducks and prairie hens. Near
the spot where is now the town of Rock Island, they
saw great herds of bison, or buffalo, and they marveled
at their stupidity and their ugliness. Whenever the
explorers landed they kept a strict guard, for fear of
an Indian attack, and as each evening came on, they
made a small fire on shore to cook their meals, then
entered the two canoes, paddled into the stream, and
slept as far from the bank as possible.</p>

<p>As the French adventurers came down the mighty
Mississippi, there were, of course, many meetings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the various Indian tribes which had their homes upon
its banks. On the 25th. day of June, they saw the
tracks of men upon the water’s edge and a narrow,
beaten path across the prairie. “It must be a road
leading to a village,” said Marquette; “we will reconnoiter
it and see what is there!”</p>

<p>Recommending themselves to God, Marquette and
Joliet undertook to investigate, and silently followed
the narrow path. They walked onward for about two
miles and then heard voices. Before them was an Indian
village. They halted, and then advanced, shouted
with all their energy. The redskins swarmed from
their huts, much excited, but, seeing the Black Robes,
of whom the traveling Hurons had told them, they
quieted down, sending four of their old men to meet
the white voyagers.</p>

<p>As the Indians approached, they bore, in their hands,
tobacco pipes, finely ornamented and adorned with various
feathers. They walked slowly, with the pipes
raised to the sun and said nothing at all. These were
calumets, or peace pipes, which they carried. As
Marquette and Joliet walked towards the village, with
an Indian on either side, they saw before them an old
man standing before a lodge, with his hands outstretched
and raised towards the sun. Looking intently
at the priest and his companion, he said:</p>

<p>“How beautiful is the sun, O Frenchmen, when you
come to visit us! All our town awaits thee, and thou
shalt enter all our cabins of peace. Welcome to the
land of the Illinois. Welcome, thrice welcome!”</p>

<p>The visitors entered the cabin, where was a crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of red men, who kept silence, but eagerly gazed upon
the strangers. Finally several spoke, saying:</p>

<p>“Well done, brothers, to visit us!”</p>

<p>Now all sat down, the peace pipe was passed around,
they smoked, and then conversed in sign-language.
But soon messengers arrived from the Grand Sachem
of the Illinois, inviting the Frenchmen to visit
his town, where he wished to hold a council with
them.</p>

<p>So the seven explorers started for the village of the
Grand Sachem, attended by a vast crowd of red men,
who, never having seen a Frenchman before, could not
apparently see enough of them. At length they
reached the lodge of the Grand Sachem, who stood in
his doorway holding his calumet, or peace pipe, towards
the sun.</p>

<p>“Welcome, my white brothers,” said he. “Welcome
to the land of the Illinois.”</p>

<p>Marquette stepped forward, and, presenting the old
man with four separate gifts of beads and of knives,
said:</p>

<p>“With this first gift, O Sachem, do I march in peace
to visit the nations on the great river, which courses to
the sea. With this second, I declare that God, the
mighty creator, has pity on you, and it is for you to
acknowledge and obey him. With this third, I declare
that the Great Chief of the French informs you that
he has spread peace everywhere, and has overcome the
Iroquois, the enemies of you all, and has put them down
forever. With this fourth I beg you to tell me the
way to the sea, so that I can reach it without having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
trouble with the nations which I must pass in order to
reach it.”</p>

<p>This speech pleased the Great Sachem mightily, and
rising, he laid his hand upon a small Indian child, saying:</p>

<p>“I thank thee, Black Gown and thee, Frenchmen,
for taking so much pains to come and visit us. Never
has the earth been so lovely nor the sun so bright as
to-day. Never has our river been so calm or so free
from rocks, for your canoes have removed them as they
passed. Never has our tobacco had so fine a flavor,
nor our corn appeared so beautiful as we behold it to-day.
Here is my son that I give thee, so that thou
mayest know my heart. I pray thee to take pity on
me and all my nation. Thou knowest the Great Spirit
who has made us all, then speak thou to him and hear
thou his words; ask thou him to give me life and
health, and to come and dwell amongst us, that we may
know him.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he gave the little Indian boy to Marquette
and then presented him with a calumet, or peace
pipe. He then urged the Frenchmen to proceed no
farther and not to expose themselves to the dangers that
would meet them with hostile tribes:</p>

<p>“I would esteem it a great happiness to lose my life
for the glory of Jesus Christ,&mdash;he who has made us
all,” replied Marquette.</p>

<p>The old Sachem marveled much at this answer.</p>

<p>After several days of pleasant intercourse with the
Illinois, the voyagers again took to their canoes and
sailed southward towards the mouth of the Mississippi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Marquette left the little Indian boy behind him, for
he did not wish to take him from his father. They
had not gone very far, when they passed a rocky promontory
where two great monsters had been painted upon
the brown stones by some Indian artist.</p>

<p>“They are as large as a calf,” says Marquette in his
diary. “They have horns on their heads like those of
a deer, a horrible look, red eyes, a beard like a tiger,
a face somewhat like a man’s, a body covered with
scales, and so long a tail that it winds all around the
body, passing above the head and going back between
the legs, ending somewhat like a fish’s tail. Green,
red, and black are the colors composing this picture.”</p>

<p>Fortunately there were no monsters in the country
similar to these awful pictures, and the worst that the
explorers encountered were dangerous masses of fallen
trees, through which the canoes had a difficult time to
wend a tortuous passage.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the Ohio River the Frenchmen
passed a part of the shore much dreaded by the redskins,
who thought that an evil Manitou lived there,
who devoured all travelers. The Illinois had warned
the good priest to avoid the place. Yet the evil monster
turned out to be a small bay full of dangerous
rocks, through which the current of the river whirled
about with a furious commotion, driving the canoes
through a narrow channel filled with frothing spray
and whirling spume. The <i>couriers de bois</i> sat tight,
paddled hard, and pulled away from this peril.</p>

<p>Yet death soon stared the navigators in the face, for,
when they reached the mouth of the Arkansas, armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
warriors saw them, plunged into the river, and approached
the two canoes, uttering fierce battle cries.
Others came from the bank in wooden boats, hurling
wooden clubs at the Frenchmen. Many redskins on
the shore seized bows and arrows, pointing them at the
explorers in a menacing manner. It was certainly a
ticklish position and one that called for all the presence
of mind that brave Pere Marquette possessed.</p>

<p>Rising in his canoe, the good priest held up the calumet,
or peace pipe, which the Illinois had given him.</p>

<p>It apparently had no effect on the young braves, and
they came swimming along, knives held in their teeth,
ready and eager for a hand-to-hand battle in the muddy
water.</p>

<p>Again the good priest raised the pipe of peace.</p>

<p>This time it had some effect, for some old men on
the bank called to the young braves to desist in their
attack, saying:</p>

<p>“Brothers, our young men shall not hurt you.
Come ashore and we will have a big feast. Ugh!
Ugh! You are welcome here.”</p>

<p>So the voyagers heaved sighs of relief, paddled
ashore, and had a grand banquet. Next day, ten of the
men of this tribe guided them farther down the stream,
and introduced them to the next tribe, which lived opposite
the mouth of the Arkansas River.</p>

<p>They seemed to like good eating as well as do the
natives of Arkansas in our day, for they had a noble
banquet at which was served boiled dog, roast corn, and
watermelon.</p>

<p>As I have said before, Father Marquette was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
suffering much with fever. As for his companions,
they wished to return, for, said one: “If we go farther
south, some Spaniards will capture us, or we will
be killed by fiercer Indians than we have yet met with.”</p>

<p>So they started to ascend the muddy river, toiling
terribly against the current, but ever watchful of a
night attack, and careful to sleep in the canoes, well
away from the bank. Yet on, on, they went towards
the north until the mouth of the river Illinois was
reached. Into this they turned, paddled to its source,
portaged into gray Lake Michigan, and soon were
homeward bound for the busy post of Sault Ste. Marie.
Marquette was quite ill with the fever and worn out
with the exertion of the long journey, so at Green Bay
he remained at the Jesuit mission of St. Francis
Xavier, established there some years before. Joliet,
on the other hand&mdash;apparently an iron man&mdash;was
feeling splendidly. He had traveled only 2,767 miles
in a birch canoe and was as well and hearty as when he
had started. A true athlete, this Joliet, and one who
must have had muscles of steel!</p>

<p>It was now September, and the explorers had been
away for five months. It was also the time of stress
and of storm on the Great Lakes, so it was thought best
to pass the winter quietly at the little mission, there
to write up the report of this wonderful journey. Both
adventurers, therefore, sat down to rest, busying themselves
in editing their journals. Marquette’s alone
has been preserved; as for Joliet’s, his was upset in
his canoe, when returning to Quebec in the following
Spring, and all of his papers were lost in the frothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
current of the raging La Chine rapids of the Ottawa
River, near Montreal. Marquette’s account, with maps
drawn from memory, reached his superiors in the
Jesuit mission at Quebec, and they are to-day of great
interest to historians, geographers, and antiquarians.</p>

<p>On the way to Green Bay, the good priest had promised
the Illinois Indians that he would return to them
in the Spring, in order to preach the gospel. Although
much shattered in health, because of the fever which
had fastened itself upon him, he again started south
in October, 1674. Dismissing his great accomplishment
from his mind, again he turned to teach the savages
the words of Christ. Reaching the Chicago
River, he found it covered with ice, so he remained at
a poor log cabin, near the shore of Lake Michigan. He
was ill, but brave, and, when the warm breath of Spring
again brought tassels to the willows, this noble priest
of God pushed southward to the country of the friendly
Illinois.</p>

<p>The redskins loved the peaceful soldier of the cross
and welcomed him, “as an angel from Heaven.”
Easter time soon came, and a great service was held for
the red men and their wives and children. First the
priest presented the chiefs with gifts of wampum to
attest his love and the importance of his mission, then
he explained the doctrine of Christianity and his reason
for journeying to this wild and distant land. “I cannot
stay longer,” he said, in conclusion, “but the peace
of God be with you.”</p>

<p>The children of the forest listened to him with great
joy and appreciation, and, at the conclusion of his address,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
begged him to return to them again. They escorted
him to his canoe with great pomp and ceremony,
many of the warriors accompanying him for thirty
miles. Then they waved “good-bye” saying: “Come
again to us, good father, for we love you right well.
Come again, for you are truly a brother of the Great
Spirit.”</p>

<p>Alas! the good priest’s strength now began to fail
him and he became so ill and weak that he had to be
carried by his faithful attendants. The season was
stormy, and, as the Frenchmen paddled northward
towards Green Bay, they had to wait in the land-locked
harbors of the St. Joseph River, the Kalamazoo, the
Grand, and the Muskegon. The white-caps raged on
Lake Michigan, so that it was not safe for the frail
birch-bark canoe to venture upon the tossing waves.</p>

<p>Poor Father Marquette! your journeys are almost
over! Ill, weak, exhausted, the gentle priest had to be
carried upon the shoulders of his faithful <i>couriers de
bois</i>.</p>

<p>“Take me to the shore,” he said, weakly. “Build
me a cabin and let me there give up my soul to Christ.
I cannot live much longer and it is well. God’s will be
done.”</p>

<p>Near the present city of Ludington, upon a plot of
rising ground, the expiring Marquette selected a place
to die. His companions made a rude, log cabin, laid
him upon a bed of evergreens, over which were stretched
his blankets, and, as the white-breasted woodthrush
sang a soft cadence from the branch of the wild apple
tree, the gentle soul of the explorer and Jesuit Missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
went to the Great Beyond. His rough boatmen
clustered about him with tears in their eyes, and they
have said that, as the noble man-of-God awaited Death,
his countenance beamed and was aglow with the spark
of a curious and brilliant radiance.</p>

<p>Spring came. Some Huron Indians, whom Marquette
had instructed at his mission at La Pointe, heard
of his death and burial as they were returning from a
hunt in the vast woods of northern Michigan. They
sought the grave of this good man, whom they had so
tenderly loved. With reverent hands they removed
him from his forest sepulchre, carried him to their
canoe, and started back to the little chapel which he had
built at St. Ignace.</p>

<p>Thirty canoes formed a funeral procession which
passed along the Great Lakes for nearly two hundred
and fifty miles. When the mission was reached, the
cortége approached the land, where a vast concourse of
Indians, trappers, soldiers, priests, and half-breeds,
paid reverence to this sweet-souled Jesuit missionary.
Here, in the little church, he was laid to rest, and here,
in 1877, a splendid monument was erected to the memory
of that noble Christian gentleman, who had floated
down the turbid current of the Mississippi in a memorable
journey of exploration. <i>Pax vobiscum, Pere
Marquette!</i></p>

<h2 class="p4">ROBERT DE LA SALLE:</h2>

<p class="pch">FRENCH ADVENTURER, AND EXPLORER OF<br />
THE VALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1643-1687)</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">WHILE good Father Marquette was gliding
over the muddied waters of the Mississippi,
gazing at wonderful sights which no Frenchman
had dreamed of heretofore, a man lived upon the
banks of the St. Lawrence who brooded over projects
of peril and adventure and gazed wistfully towards
the Far West. This was no other than Robert,
Chevalier de La Salle, a Frenchman who had come to
Canada about the year 1667. He had been born at
Rouen, in Normandy, of a noble family, and had been
well educated in a Jesuit seminary.</p>

<p>Urged onward by a desire for both adventure and
money, this vigorous young blade emigrated to Canada.
Here he traveled up and down the great river
St. Lawrence from Tadoussac to Sault Ste. Marie, and
busied himself in trading European merchandise for
beaver, bear, and other skins. He built houses for the
storage of furs and merchandise, made excursions
among the Indian tribes bordering on the shore of Lake
Ontario, and penetrated as far as the Huron country
in the north, where he lived for some time among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
redskins, learning their life, their manners, and their
language.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you have taken the steamer at Toronto,
have threaded your way among the beautiful
Thousand Isles, and have shot through the foaming
spray of the Lachine rapids, before reaching the city
of Montreal. This seething cataract was named by the
adventurous La Salle, for he hoped to find the St. Lawrence
leading into the China Sea, and, to commemorate
this anticipation, called the trading station, upon the
Island of Montreal&mdash;La Chine (or the China) a name
which has fastened itself to the rapids, and a name
which it has borne to the present day.</p>

<p>Here the adventurous Frenchman was resting when
word was brought to him of the expedition of Marquette
and Joliet. He felt certain that the Mississippi
discharged itself into the great Gulf of Mexico, a fact
which inflamed his desire to complete the discovery of
that mighty watercourse. He wished to found colonies
upon its banks and to open up new avenues of trade
between France and the vast countries of the West.
Nor did he lose his visions of China and Japan.
From the head-waters of the Mississippi, he still hoped
to find a passage to those distant countries, and thus,
stirred with ideas of conquest and glory for his beloved
France, he made a voyage to his native shores towards
the end of the year 1677, hoping to gain assistance
from the King for his ambitious designs.</p>

<p>The French monarch gave a ready ear to the talk of
the venturesome Canadian. He was authorized to push
his discoveries as far as he chose to the westward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
to build forts wherever he should think proper. In order
to meet the large expense of his labors he was given
the exclusive traffic in buffalo skins. Yet he was also
forbidden to trade with the Hurons and other Indians,
who usually brought furs to Montreal, for fear that he
would interfere with the established traders and incur
their jealousy and displeasure.</p>

<p>La Salle had the true love of adventure, a passion
for exploring unknown lands, and an ambition to build
up a great name for himself which should rival that of
the early discoverers and conquerors of the New World.
He wished, in fact, to die great. Let us see how he
succeeded!</p>

<p>Two months after receiving this patent, the adventurer
sailed from the shores of France, accompanied by
the Chevalier Tonty, the Sieur de La Motte, and a pilot,
ship-carpenters, mariners and other persons, about
thirty in all. He had also a quantity of arms and ammunition,
with a store of anchors, cordage, and other
materials necessary for rigging the small vessels which
he had determined to construct for the navigation of
the lakes.</p>

<p>He arrived at Quebec near the end of September;
but here he remained no longer than was necessary to
arrange his affairs, for he hastened forward, passed up
the dangerous rapids of the St. Lawrence in canoes,
and at length reached Fort Frontenac, which he had
erected at the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario, where
the St. Lawrence issues from that great, blue inland
sea.</p>

<p>La Salle was eager for exploration. Busily he prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to build and equip a vessel above the Falls of
Niagara, so that he could navigate the upper lakes.
His men worked hard and had, before long, fitted out
a brigantine of ten tons in which they stowed away
everything needed for the construction of a second vessel.
This barque had been made at Fort Frontenac,
the year before, with two others, which were used for
bringing supplies. It was a small boat, but was suitable
for the purpose.</p>

<p>In order to have any success in building a fort and
a ship on the waters of the Niagara River, it was necessary
to have the good will of the red men who lived
in the surrounding country. The Senecas here had
their hunting grounds, and they were a powerful tribe,
excellent in the hunting field, bloodthirsty on the field
of war. So La Motte had orders from La Salle to go
on an embassy to this nation, to hold a council with the
chiefs, explain his object, and gain their consent.</p>

<p>With some well-armed men, La Motte consequently
traveled about thirty miles through the woods, and
came, at length, to the great village of these redskins.
Before a roaring council fire, around which the Indians
gathered with their usual grave and serious
countenances, both white men and red delivered many
speeches. The French promised to establish a blacksmith
at Niagara, who should repair the guns of the
red men, and, as a result of this guarantee, the Senecas
gave them permission to establish a trading place and
fort in the wilderness. Well satisfied with the mission,
La Motte and his companions went back to
Niagara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>La Salle soon arrived, sailing thither from Fort
Frontenac in one of his small vessels, laden with provisions,
with merchandise, and materials for rigging
the new ship: the first to glide over the waves of these
great western lakes. In person he visited the Seneca
Indians, and, by soft speech and flattering words, secured
their friendship and good-will.</p>

<p>Yet he had enemies, too, for the monopoly which he
had gained from the government and the large scale
upon which he conducted his affairs, raised, against
him, a host of traducers among the traders and merchants
of Canada. In order to thwart his designs,
they told the Indians that his plans of building forts
and ships on the border was in order to curb their
power. Agents were sent among the redskins in order
to sow the seeds of hostility to this ambitious
Frenchman.</p>

<p>These moves against him were well known to La
Salle, yet it did not put an end to his plans. About
two miles above the Falls of Niagara, he selected a
place for a dock-yard at the outlet of a creek, on the
western side of the Niagara River. Here the keel of
the new vessel was laid, and, in a very short time, her
form began to appear. An Indian woman brought
word that a plot had been hatched to burn the vessel,
while it was on the stocks, yet the redskins did not
molest it, and soon she proudly glided into the water.
She was called the <i>Griffin</i>, in honor of the Count de
Frontenac, who had two griffins upon his coat of arms.</p>

<p>It was the month of August, a time of softness and
mellow sunlight in the Canadian wilderness, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
bathed in a flood of radiance, the sails of the <i>Griffin</i>
were spread to the winds of Lake Erie. Heretofore,
only birch-bark canoes had floated upon the surface of
this wind-tossed sheet of water, now a real vessel was
plowing a westward course over the rocking billows.
The voyage was a prosperous one, and, on the 27th. day
of August, the little company of explorers, thirty-four
in all, reached the Island of Mackinac, where the redskinned
denizens of the forest looked with wonder and
amazement upon this ship, the first which they had
ever seen, calling her the <i>great wooden canoe</i>.</p>

<p>The Sieur de La Salle dressed himself in a scarlet
cloak, in order to make an impression upon the redskins,
and, attended by some of his soldiers, made a
visit of ceremony to the head men of the village. Here
his missionaries celebrated mass, and here he was received
and entertained with much civility by the red
men. Yet, although the redskins showed him much
courtesy on the surface, their minds had been poisoned
by the lies which had been circulated among them by
his enemies, and for the same reason several of his
followers had deserted. Not deterred by this happening,
La Salle again entered his ship, hoisted sail, and
soon was coasting along the northern borders of Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>After a voyage of about a hundred miles the <i>Griffin</i>
reached Green Bay, where anchor was cast before a
small island at its mouth. This island was inhabited
by Pottawattomies, and here La Salle found several
Frenchmen, who had preceded him in birch canoes, had
gathered a supply of stores, and had also collected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
vast quantity of furs. With these he loaded his vessel;
sent it back to Niagara, for the purpose of satisfying
his creditors; and ordered his navigators to return
as soon as possible, and to pursue their voyage to the
mouth of the Miami River at the south-eastern extremity
of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>The adventurers now remaining consisting of fourteen
persons, who were soon paddling down the west
shore of Lake Michigan in four bark canoes, laden with
carpenters’ tools, a blacksmith’s forge, merchandise,
and arms. After a stormy passage, they reached the
mouth of the Miami River, since called the St. Joseph.
Winter was approaching, hostile natives were near, so
La Salle determined to build a fort. A hill was selected
as the proper position for the stockade, the
bushes were chopped down and logs were cut and hewn,
so that a breastwork could be constructed, inclosing
a space about eighty feet long, by forty broad. It was
surrounded by palisades and was called Fort Miami.</p>

<p>All hands were thus kept busy during the month of
November. In spite of this occupation, the men were
very discontented, for they had no other food but the
flesh of bears, which some Indian hunters killed in the
woods. The Frenchmen did not like this, and wished
to go into the woods in order to hunt deer and other
game. This permission was refused by La Salle, as
he saw that they were more bent upon desertion than
upon assisting in improving the larder.</p>

<p>As they thus grumbled and worked at the edge of
the wilderness, the Chevalier de Tonty came down the
lake with two canoes well stocked with deer which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
had recently killed. Hurrah! Here was a different
kind of meat, at last, and this cheered the spirits of all
the company. Yet there was bad news, also, for the
good Chevalier brought word of the total loss of the
ship which had brought them hither. No sight had
ever been had of her, and, although the red men, who
lived along the shores of Lake Michigan were closely
questioned, no one brought any word of the ill-fated
<i>Griffin</i>, which doubtless had been swallowed up by the
waves of Lake Michigan, while on her way from the
island of Mackinac. La Salle was much distressed,
yet he had become accustomed to the buffeting of ill
fortune in the wilderness, and, consequently turned
again towards the wilderness with renewed courage
and resolution to go onward, to explore, and to bring
back news of these virgin forests and this interesting
country.</p>

<p>An Indian hunter, who had been sent out to look
for deer, came and told them where there was a portage
to the head-waters of the Kankakee River. So,
desirous of moving onward, they followed him down
stream and paddled for a hundred miles on the muddy
waters, which wound through marshes and a dense
growth of tall rushes and alder bushes. The adventurers
became much in need of provisions, for at
this season the buffalo had traveled south; yet, they
succeeded in killing two deer, several wild turkeys, and
a few swans. Providence also came to their relief, for
a stray buffalo was found sticking fast in a marsh, and
it was therefore captured with ease.</p>

<p>At length the canoes floated upon the waters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Illinois River, and, as they paddled onward, the voyagers
came upon an Indian village where were great
quantities of corn. The inhabitants had departed upon
a hunt, so the ravenous Frenchmen appropriated a large
store of grain for their own use. They kept on their
way, reached a great lake, called Lake Peoria, and
found a second Indian village upon the bank, the inhabitants
of which met them with great friendliness
and good will.</p>

<p>Here La Salle decided to build a fort. It was named
Fort Crèvecœur, or the Broken Heart, so called because
of the sadness which he had experienced at the
loss of the good ship <i>Griffin</i>. The men also constructed
a brigantine, forty-two feet long and twelve feet broad,
in which it was hoped to make further discoveries in
the Mississippi. When it had been completed, a priest,
called Father Hennepin, was sent down the Illinois
River to make further explorations, not in this boat,
but in a canoe, accompanied by two Frenchmen and an
Indian; while La Salle, himself, determined to begin
an overland journey to Fort Frontenac, assisted by
three Frenchmen and an Indian hunter. The Chevalier
de Tonty was left in command of the fort, with
sixteen men and two missionaries.</p>

<p>La Salle had quite an undertaking before him, but
he did not quail. He was to travel over land, and on
foot, through vast forests and through bogs and
morasses, to Fort Frontenac, a distance of twelve hundred
miles. He had to journey along the southern
shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, ford numerous
rivers and cross others on rafts, all of this in a season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
when snow hid the ground and floating ice rendered
traveling most fatiguing. Nothing seemed impossible
to his strong heart and unbending resolution. Shouldering
his knapsack and musket, he bade adieu to his
companions of the wilderness, and set his face towards
far distant Canada.</p>

<p>No record has been preserved of the incidents of his
long and perilous journey from the slow-moving Illinois
to the blue and sparkling St. Lawrence. At any rate,
he arrived without mishap at Fort Frontenac, where
he was chagrined and mortified to find his affairs in a
condition of confusion that was deplorable. His
heaviest loss, of course, was that of the <i>Griffin</i>, with
her cargo valued at twelve thousand dollars; but, besides
this mishap, he found that his agents had despoiled
him of all the profits of his trade. Some of
his employees, in fact, had stolen his goods and had
run away with them to the Dutch of New York. A
rumor had been circulated to the effect that he and his
whole party had been drowned on their voyage up the
lakes, so his creditors had seized upon his effects, and
had wasted them by forced sales. All Canada seemed
to have conspired against him. Many a less resolute
heart than his own would have failed, but despair was
never known to settle upon the mind of the Chevalier
La Salle. He was the first Theodore Roosevelt of the
United States.</p>

<p>The adventurer had still one friend left,&mdash;Count
Frontenac, whose influence and authority was now exerted
in his favor. They discussed together the Mississippi
problem and determined to give up the plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of navigating this mighty water-course in a ship. Instead,
La Salle decided to prosecute his explorations
with canoes.</p>

<p>He engaged more men, left Fort Frontenac on the
23d. day of July, 1680, and, although detained by head
winds on Lake Ontario, reached Mackinac during the
month of September. By offering brandy in exchange
for Indian corn, he soon had enough to satisfy his needs,
and, embarking on the rough waters of Lake Michigan,
at length arrived at the mouth of the river Miami.
The fort which he had left there had been
plundered and dismantled!</p>

<p>Journeying south, La Salle reached the villages of
the Illinois, which he found had been sacked and burned
by the Iroquois during his absence. He saw nothing
of Tonty and those Frenchmen whom he had left behind
him, a proof that they had either been killed or
dispersed. So he returned to the Miami River and
here spent the winter, visiting the Indian tribes near
Lake Michigan. Here he learned that the Iroquois
had attacked the settlements of the Illinois with vindictive
ferocity, during his absence, driving the red
men far westward across the Mississippi. As for the
Frenchmen, whom he had left behind him, no one
seemed to know what had become of them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, 1681, the vigorous explorer
left the Miami River, and, after a prosperous
voyage, once more entered the harbor of Mackinac.
What was his joy to here find the Chevalier Tonty and
those Frenchmen, whom he had last seen in the wilderness.
They had passed through great dangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
but had at length escaped from the bloodthirsty Iroquois
and had reached the French fortress, lean, haggard,
but praising God that they had escaped with
their lives. La Salle embraced them all, gave them
presents of firearms and blankets, and begged them to
accompany him again into the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Chevalier was now determined to journey down
the entire length of the Mississippi, and, with this end
in view, took into his service a company of Frenchmen,
together with a number of eastern Indians, Abenakis,
and Loups, or Mahingans, as they were called by the
French writers. Putting Fort Frontenac in command
of the Sieur de La Forest, he journeyed by canoe to
Niagara, where a stockade had recently been built,
called Fort de Tonty, and thence embarked with his
entire company in canoes for the Miami River, which
he reached in safety. Six weeks were now spent in
making arrangements for the great trip down the
river.</p>

<p>There were twenty-three Frenchmen in the party,
eighteen savages, ten Indian women, and three children.
The redskins insisted on taking these women
with them to prepare their food, according to their
custom, while they were fishing and hunting. When
all was ready the adventurers started for the mouth of
the Chicago River, which was found to be frozen.</p>

<p>Undaunted, the explorers passed down the water-course
on sleds, down the Illinois to Lake Peoria, and
thence to the muddy waters of the Mississippi. They
had a peaceful passage southward, hunting much and
fishing in the stream, and eventually arrived at the
Chickasaw Bluffs. Here redskins were met with, who
gave them kind treatment, and, pushing on, the little
party soon arrived at a mighty village of the Arkansas
Indians.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>These redskins were a frank and open-hearted people
of gentle manners, and very hospitable. The Sieur de
La Salle was treated with marked deference and respect.
He took possession of the country in the name
of the King of France, erected a cross, and adorned it
with the arms of his native country. This was done
with great pomp and ceremony, the savages believing
that it was a ritual for their amusement. Two weeks
were pleasantly spent among the red men and then the
voyagers kept on their way.</p>

<p>The journey to the mouth of the mighty water-course
was easy and pleasant. Many Indian tribes
were met with, but no battles occurred. Finally, on
the 6th. day of April, the river was observed to divide
itself into three channels, so the Sieur de La Salle separated
his company into three divisions and, putting himself
at the head of one of them, he took the western
channel, the Chevalier de Tonty the middle, and the
Sieur Dautray the eastern. The water soon became
brackish, then salt, until, at last, the broad ocean
opened up before them. La Salle encamped for the
night about twelve miles above the mouth of the western
branch, and the next day he and Tonty examined
the shores bordering on the sea in order to ascertain
the depth of the waters in the two principal channels.
The day following was employed in searching for a dry
place, removed from the tide and the inundation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
rivers, on which to erect a column and a cross. Next
day this ceremony was performed.</p>

<p>All the Frenchmen were drawn up under arms, while
a column was erected with this inscription:</p>

<p>“<i>Louis the Great, King of France and Navarre,
reigns; the 9th. of April, 1682.</i>”</p>

<p>The <i>Te Deum</i> was now chanted and the soldiers discharged
their muskets with shouts of <i>Long Live the
King!</i> La Salle then made a formal speech, taking
possession of the whole country of Louisiana for the
French King, the nations and people contained therein,
the seas and harbors adjacent, and all the streams flowing
into the Mississippi, which he called the great
river St. Louis. A leaden plate was then buried at
the foot of a tree, with a Latin inscription, containing
the arms of France and the date, and stating that La
Salle, Tonty, Lenobe, and twenty Frenchmen were the
first to navigate the river from the Illinois to its mouth.
The cross was then erected with appropriate ceremonies.
At the same time an account of these proceedings was
drawn up, in the form of a Proces Verbal, certified by
a Notary and signed by thirteen of the principal persons
of the expedition.</p>

<p>La Salle felt happy, for he had seen, he had come,
he had conquered!</p>

<p>Although the journey up the Mississippi was without
danger, La Salle, when he reached the upper
courses, was seized with a dangerous illness which made
it impossible for him to go forward for forty days.
The Chevalier de Tonty was dispatched to Mackinac
in order to inform the Count de Frontenac of the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of the voyage, and then, by slow stages, La
Salle reached the Miami River, where he arrived by
the end of September.</p>

<p>Tonty was faithful and accurate in executing his
orders, so faithful that, shortly afterwards, when La
Salle was well enough to sail for France, he left him
in charge of all his interests during his absence.</p>

<p>The explorer met with a favorable reception in the
old world, and it was decided that an expedition
should be fitted out, for which the Government should
provide vessels, troops, munitions, and such other supplies
as were wanted: the whole to be under his command.
He was authorized to establish colonies in
Louisiana, and to take command of the immense country
and all of its inhabitants from Lake Michigan to
the borders of Mexico. He was given four vessels and
was furnished with two hundred and eighty men.</p>

<p>Certainly his own government thought well of him,
even if other people did not, so he and his men started
for the Gulf of Mexico, determined to there found a
colony which would perpetuate the name of France for
all time in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The history of this expedition is an unfortunate one.
In four vessels the adventurers crossed the ocean, intending
to land at the mouth of the Mississippi. There
were about two hundred and eighty persons in all, including
many missionaries and soldiers, the latter being
an assemblage of vagabonds and beggars from the
streets, some of whom had never handled a musket.
The vessels touched at the island of Santo Domingo,
then crossed over into the Gulf of Mexico, heading, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
all thought, for the mouth of the Mississippi. But
such was not the case, and the explorers touched land
near the borders of Mexico, at the Magdalen River,
where the soil was barren and sandy, and where there
was little game.</p>

<p>At different times, parties landed, hunted the wild
buffalo, and explored the flat and somewhat desolate
country. They constructed a fort with the timbers
and planks of one of their ships, which floated ashore
after the vessel went to pieces, and also with drift
wood from the beach. After this was done, the Sieur
de La Salle, taking fifty men with him, set out on a
tour of discovery, finding a flat game-filled country and
a noble river which he called the Vaches, because of
the great numbers of wild cows, or buffaloes, seen upon
its banks. This name it still retains.</p>

<p>After a journey of considerable length, the Chevalier
returned, built a new fort, and then set out upon another
journey of discovery. Many of his men died of
exposure and rattlesnake bites, but this never disturbed
the even calm of his manner. He pressed on, found
the great Colorado River, and crossed it, penetrating
into the wilderness for many miles. After an absence
of more than four months, La Salle was again received
with joy by the colonists at the fort. His men were
ragged in dress, some without hats, and all were haggard
and worn by exposure.</p>

<p>The Indians had always shown themselves to be
hostile and had murdered several of the French explorers
when they had strayed away from their companies.
Of the four vessels which had brought over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the expedition, three had returned, and the last, the
<i>la Belle</i>, had been destroyed by a storm. The Sieur
de La Salle was thus cut off from all supplies in a new
country, two thousand miles from any civilized settlement
to which he could look for succor, and surrounded
on every side by hostile savages. It is no wonder that
many of his followers were dissatisfied and miserably
unhappy, some even plotted to kill their great and gallant
leader.</p>

<p>Of the many expeditions which I have taken into
the wilderness, with parties of men, none has ever been
tranquil throughout. There is always some evil dispositioned
fellow along, who raises a disturbance,
makes others unhappy, and, by his surly manner, creates
uneasiness and distrust, so that all are happy when
the settlements have been reached and the malcontents
have been allowed to go their ways in peace. So it
was here. There were several Frenchmen of a jealous
and mean disposition, who, feeling ill-humored because
of their hardships in the wilderness, felt it their duty
to murder the only true man among them all: the valiant
leader. It was easy to succeed in their evil design.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the Mississippi River was the Chevalier
Tonty, the staunch friend and companion of La
Salle, and a man who was as brave and as valiant as
this courageous Frenchman. Why not go in search of
him? The proposition was a good one, and La Salle
determined to take only the bravest and the strongest;
to travel eastward; to reach the Mississippi, and to
there find, if possible, his brave and noble companion-in-arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a wonderful trip. The valiant Frenchman
and his companions crossed unknown rivers, broad
prairies, and flat plateaus. A crocodile seized one of
the soldiers by the leg and dragged him to destruction,
in one instance; in another, several of the French adventurers
were badly gored by buffalo.</p>

<p>La Salle finally reached the land of the Cencis Indians,
the future home of many a Daniel Boone, a perfect
paradise for the sportsman and a land of noble
rivers, beautiful valleys, and much wild game. He
was charmed with it, he reveled in its scenery, its beautiful
valleys, its wonderful water courses, yet, here it
was that he was to meet his end, an event as sad and
tragic as any of the great events of American history.</p>

<p>On the 15th. day of March, 1687, the adventurers
came to a place where the Sieur de La Salle had buried
a quantity of Indian corn and beans on his last journey,
and he ordered his followers, Duhaut, Hiens, Liolot,
Larcheveque, Teissier, Nika, and his footman Saget,
to go and bring it away. They found the place, but
the corn and the beans were spoiled. Nika was fortunate
in killing two buffalo, and the others dispatched
Saget to inform the commander of this fact, and requested
him to send horses for the meat. La Salle,
consequently, directed Moraquet, De Marie, and Saget
to return with horses and to send back one of them
loaded with the flesh of the buffalo, for immediate use,
and to wait until the rest was dried.</p>

<p>Moraquet arrived, found that the meat had been
smoked, though it was not dry enough for this process,
and Duhaut and the others had laid aside certain parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
to be roasted for themselves, which, it seems, was the
custom on similar occasions. Moraquet, in a passionate
manner, reprimanded them for what they had done,
and took away, not only the smoked meat, but the
pieces which they had reserved, saying, in a menacing
tone:</p>

<p>“Comrades, I will do with it as I please!”</p>

<p>This irritated the rest. Duhaut had an old grudge
against Moraquet, and was quite ready to take revenge.
He brought over Liolot and Hiens to help him accomplish
his purpose, and finally the others, and they
determined to murder Moraquet, Nika and Saget. In
the night, when the unsuspecting victims were asleep,
they were butchered with an ax.</p>

<p>The bloody work had commenced, why not let it continue?
The conspirators laid a scheme, on the spot,
to destroy the Sieur de La Salle. They would shoot
him.</p>

<p>Meantime, the courageous leader of the expedition
expressed anxiety at the long absence of Moraquet,
and seemed to have forebodings of some unhappy event.
He feared, indeed, that the whole party might have
been cut off by the savages. He determined, finally,
to go in search of them, leaving the camp on the 19th.
day of March, in charge of Jontel. With Father Anastase,
and two natives who had served him as guides,
he started out to look for his companions in arms.</p>

<p>The valiant French explorer traveled for about six
miles, when he found the bloody cravat of Saget, one
of the murdered men, near the bank of a river, and,
at the same time, two eagles were seen hovering over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
their heads, as if attracted by food somewhere on the
ground.</p>

<p>La Salle thought that the party must be near, and
fired his gun to draw the attention of those whom he
wished to find. Duhaut and Larcheveque immediately
came across the river and advanced to meet him.
La Salle approached, saying:</p>

<p>“Where is the good Moraquet? Has anything happened
to him?”</p>

<p>“He is along the river,” answered Larcheveque.</p>

<p>At that moment, Duhaut, who was concealed in the
high grass, discharged his musket, and shot the unsuspecting
Chevalier through the head. He fell forward
upon his face, and Father Anastase, who was
standing at his side, expected to share the same fate,
until the conspirators told him that they had no design
upon his life.</p>

<p>La Salle lived for about an hour, unable to speak,
but continually pressed the hand of the good priest to
signify that he understood what was said to him.
Finally he passed away, and was buried by the kind
father, who shed tears over the body of this brave and
valiant adventurer.</p>

<p>Thus perished the wise Chevalier: generous, engaging,
adroit, skillful, and capable of any accomplishment.
He died in the full vigor of life, in the midst
of his career and his labors, without the consolation
of having seen the results of his great explorations.
In some of the higher attributes of character, such as
personal courage and endurance, undaunted resolution,
patience under trials, and perseverance in contending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
with obstacles and struggling through embarrassments
that might appall the stoutest heart, there is, I believe,
no man who surpassed this Sieur de La Salle. He
was cool and intrepid at all times, never yielding for a
moment to despair, or even to despondency, and he
bore the heavy burden of his responsibilities manfully
until the end. To him and to good Father Marquette
must be mainly ascribed the discovery of the vast regions
of the Mississippi Valley and its subsequent occupation
and settlement by the French. His name
must therefore always hold a high position among those
adventurous souls who struggled to conquer, to colonize,
and to explore the vast American Continent,
when it was a wilderness inhabited by wild men and
wild beasts, and unknown to those of a white complexion.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">A SONG OF THE MISSISSIPPI</p>

<p class="ppind p1">Down where the muddied waters run and boil in a rushing flood,</p>
<p class="ppind">On the banks of the stream, as if in a dream, a stalwart Frenchman stood.</p>
<p class="ppind">And the mocking bird from a blossoming spray sang a song which was joyous and gay;</p>
<p class="ppind">As the welcoming sun shone on cutlass and gun, these words he trilled through the day:</p>

<p class="ppind p1">“<i>La Salle! La Salle! O brave La Salle!</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>You’re a man of France, I know,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>La Salle! La Salle! O good La Salle!</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>You can shoot with the gun and the bow.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>La Salle! La Salle! O true La Salle!</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>I salute your courage and love,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>For the lilies of France, may they wave, may they dance, o’er this watery waste from above.</i>”</p>

<p class="ppind p1">And the Frenchman raised his eyes on high and sighed as he gazed afar,</p>
<p class="ppind">Where the buffalo grunted and roared on the plain, and the dun-colored prong-horns are.</p>
<p class="ppind">And he swore an oath, it was round and long, to protect this land for France,</p>
<p class="ppind">By hook and crook, by sword and book, by pike and silvery lance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppind p1">“<i>La Salle! La Salle! O brave La Salle!”</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Sang the bird on the waving branch,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>“La Salle! La Salle! O good La Salle!</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>You’re a soldier true and staunch.</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>O take this land, with its silvery sand, for the King and Queen you serve;</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>And bring us peace; make the redskins cease,</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>From warfare make them swerve.</i>”</p>

<p class="ppind p1">So the Frenchman stayed, and his men were afraid to leave the land he’d found,</p>
<p class="ppind">Yet they hated their leader bold and brave, and determined to have him downed.</p>
<p class="ppind">And they hatched a plot, the bloodthirsty lot, to shoot the bold and good,</p>
<p class="ppind">Alas! ’twas sad that men were so bad, for they killed him where he stood.</p>

<p class="ppind p1">And the Mississippi gurgled on; it romped, it waved, it ran,</p>
<p class="ppind">It pushed by silvery beaches, and it curled by the homes of man,</p>
<p class="ppind">While the mocker sat on the whispery branch, it sang and caroled away:</p>

<p class="ppind p1">“<i>La Salle! La Salle! O brave La Salle!</i></p>
<p class="ppind"><i>Too bad! Too bad! Good day!</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">ROBERT EDWIN PEARY:</h2>

<p class="pch">DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH POLE.</p>

<p class="pch2">(1856-)</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IMAGINE the sensation which was caused when
there suddenly appeared in the newspapers the following
telegram:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“April the 6th., 1909. Stars and Stripes nailed
to the Pole.</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Peary.</span>”</p></div>

<p>People were astonished and looked amazed. Could
it be possible that the North Pole had at last been discovered,
after hundreds of years of effort upon the part
of numerous adventurers, many of whom had never
come back to tell the tale? Was it true that, after
twenty-three years of effort, Commander Peary had at
last reached the most northern point upon the earth’s
surface? Yes, it seemed to be the fact. At last the
North Pole had been trod upon by the foot of a white
man.</p>

<p>Instantly the news was scattered from St. John’s,
New Brunswick, and from New York, to the four
corners of the globe, and a great shout of enthusiastic
congratulation went up from every place where civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
men were gathered together, for all the world had
been watching the plucky commander of the United
States Navy, who, for twenty-three years, had been
working upon the problem of how to reach the North
Pole. “Hurrah! Hurrah for Peary!” was heard
on every side. “He has been victorious where hundreds
have failed. Again Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Those who disbelieved the first telegram were soon
assured by others that the Pole had really been reached,
for Mr. Herbert L. Bridgman, Secretary of the Peary
Arctic Club, was telegraphed to as follows:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Pole reached. <i>Roosevelt</i> safe.</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Peary.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">And, still later, the Commander’s devoted wife at
South Harpswell, Maine, received the message:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Have made good at last. I have the old Pole.
Am well. Love. Will wire again from Chateau.</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Bert.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Now there could be no doubt that the great feat had
really been accomplished and soon a wireless message
from Indian Harbor, Labrador, told that the good ship
<i>Roosevelt</i> was there with all safe on board, and was
steaming southward as fast as she was able.</p>

<p>At length she arrived at New York. A throng of
newspapermen and citizens gathered immediately
around the bold explorer, who, with his companions,
was given a royal welcome home. This was as it
should have been, for Peary was the only man who had
really stood upon the very top of this sphere upon
which we live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Edwin Peary, who “nailed the Stars and
Stripes to the North Pole,” was born in Cresson, Pennsylvania,
May 6th., 1856. When still a mere lad he
moved to Portland, Maine, and, after studying in private
schools and an academy in North Bridgton, Maine,
he entered Bowdoin College, graduating in 1877. He
now became a draughtsman in the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey, then passed a stiff examination and
entered the United States Navy as a Civil Engineer,
ranking as a Lieutenant. In 1884, or three years later,
he was an assistant government engineer in the surveys
for the proposed route for the Nicaragua Canal, inventing
several rolling locks for the use of the workmen.
He became engineer-in-chief of the Nicaragua
Survey.</p>

<p>About this time he began to have ideas connected
with the search for the North Pole, and, obtaining a
short leave of absence, made a trip into Greenland, accompanied
by a Dane called Margaard. A faithful
negro, named Matthew Henson, who had served with
him in Nicaragua, followed him to the Arctic on this
trip, and continued to be with him upon all his subsequent
expeditions.</p>

<p>Upon his return to civilization, the explorer immediately
began to spend his spare time in preparing for
another expedition to the north. He married, meanwhile,
Miss Josephine Diebitsch whom he had met in
Maine when a young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1891-92 he again made a trip into the frozen
fastnesses of the polar region, which was financed by
the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.
The Expedition was thoroughly organized before the
men started north, and supplies were left at convenient
points, so that starvation would not kill off the
adventurers as it had done to so many other explorers.</p>

<p>Establishing headquarters at McCormick Bay, on
the western coast of Greenland, Peary and his men
made sledge excursions along Whale Sound, Inglefield
Gulf, and Humboldt Glacier, proving that the coasts
of Greenland converged at the northern portion, doubtless
forming an island of what was thought to be a
peninsula. Although his leg was broken when crossing
Melville Bay, the brave explorer persisted in his work,
and returned in September, 1892, with a brilliant record
of results accomplished.</p>

<p>With one companion, Astrup, he had ascended to
the summit of the great ice cap which covers the interior
of Greenland, 5,000 to 8,000 feet in elevation,
and had pushed northward for 500 miles over a region
where no white man had ever been before. The temperature
was from 10 degrees to 50 degrees below zero.
On July 4th., 1892, he discovered Independence Bay,
and found a valley nearby, which was radiant with
gorgeous flowers and was alive with murmuring bees.
Here also were many musk-oxen, browsing lazily upon
the long, rank grasses.</p>

<p>The explorer now determined to spend his life in an
attempt to reach the Pole, which lay 396 geographical
miles farther north than any man had yet penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
on the western hemisphere. He was convinced that
the only way to eventually reach his goal was by adopting
the manner of life, the food, the snowhouses, and
the clothing of the Eskimos, who had learned how to
combat the rigors of Arctic weather by centuries of
experience. He must also utilize the game of the
northland, the walrus, the musk-oxen, and the reindeer,
in order to keep his men in fit condition and of good
temper when the long winter night came upon them.
Lastly he must train the Eskimos so that they should
become his sledging crew.</p>

<p>The first north polar expedition lasted for four years,
from 1898 to 1902, and Peary failed to get nearer than
343 miles of the Pole. Each year dense packs of ice
blocked his passage to the polar ocean and he was compelled
to make his base 700 miles from the Pole, or
200 miles south of the headquarters of Nares, from
which point he could reach the Pole in one season.
But during this period, he explored and mapped hundreds
of miles of the coastline of Greenland and of the
islands to the west and north.</p>

<p>The navigator and explorer now designed and constructed
the <i>Roosevelt</i>, a boat built to withstand the
crush of the masses of ice, and with this he battled a
way to the desired haven upon the shores of the polar
sea. From this place he made a wonderful march to
the point 87° 6´, or nearer to the Pole than any man
had ever been. He would have reached the Pole, this
time, but winds of excessive fury opened great leads
and robbed him of the prize and nearly of his own life.
This was in 1906.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Commander Peary was now resolved to make his
next advance upon the Pole by the same route as he
had just used. His previous efforts had been financed
by Mr. Morris K. Jessup, whose interest in Polar explorations,
and faith in Peary, made him willing at all
times to furnish whatever money the Commander required.
But the kind Mr. Jessup was now dead and
the explorer knew that he would have a difficult
time to raise the funds to equip another expedition.</p>

<p>Commander Peary had established a training school
for the Eskimos and their dogs at Etah, and he now
learned of the departure of Dr. Frederick A. Cook,
who had served with him upon a previous expedition,
and Mr. John R. Bradley, a noted sportsman, to this
point. He knew that these men might use his Eskimo
friends, with their dogs, for a “dash” to the Pole,
while he was held behind a prisoner in New York,
because of the lack of funds. Yet, what could he do
without the money?</p>

<p>The <i>Roosevelt</i> was in bad shape and needed overhauling.
She was built in Maine by the Peary Arctic
Club for the expedition of 1905 and was designed by
the explorer himself. She was a three-masted, fore-and-aft
schooner-rigged steamship, built entirely of
white oak with treble frames close together, double
planked. Her walls were 24 to 30 inches thick. Her
heavy bow was backed by 12 feet of solid deadwood.
Her keel was 16 inches thick and was reënforced with
false keels and a keelson. Her stern, reënforced by
iron, had a long overhang to protect the rudder from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
the ice, and the rudder itself was so arranged that it
could be lifted out of the water, when jammed or entangled.</p>

<p>It was out of the question to go in 1907, but, by the
next season a great deal of work had been done and
sufficient funds had been secured to make the good, old
ship strong and ready again, and to fill her with necessary
stores. A crew was secured, presents for the Eskimos
were on board, and material for sledges, dog
harness, guns, ammunition, and scientific instruments.
The ship’s sides were strengthened, her machinery was
made as good as new, and so, at last, she steamed up
the East River, outward bound.</p>

<p>On July 7th., 1908, she stopped near Sagamore Hill,
Long Island, the home of the then President Roosevelt,
and the chief Executive grasped the explorer by the
hand, bidding him: “Good luck and God speed!”</p>

<p>The voyager replied that he had never before felt
so confident of winning the Pole and would reach it,
this time, or “bust.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt laughed and waved “good-bye,” as
the staunch craft, which bore his name, plowed forth
into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Reaching Etah in safety, a number of Eskimos were
taken on board, and, pointing her nose toward the
north, the <i>Roosevelt</i> disappeared into a murky fog. A
ship called the Erik was nearby, and soon returned to
civilization with the last words from Peary and his
men. This was in August, 1908.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Roosevelt</i> was steadily pushed northward,
through the defiles of Kennedy and Robeson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
channels, where the moving ice opened here and there
and allowed the vessel to steal between the floes. Three
weeks later the Arctic Ocean came in sight. Entering
it, the steamer was turned to the left and was pushed
along the coast as rapidly as could be done against the
ice pack. Commander Peary meant, if possible, to
reach Cape Columbia, a headland well to the west and
on the north coast of Grant Land. Yet he could not
do this, for the ice, which pressed against the promontory
of Cape Sheridan, shut off any progress beyond
that point. Thus, on the first day of September, the
<i>Roosevelt</i> was laid to in a snug harbor under the protection
of Cape Sheridan, and the crew went into winter
quarters.</p>

<p>The men amused themselves hunting polar bears,
musk-oxen, and caribou during the long months which
had to be passed before the “dash” could be attempted.
The continuous night at length wore itself to a close,
and, in February, the first gray light of the approaching
Arctic dawn began to dispel the darkness.</p>

<p>Upon the fifteenth of that month, 1909, a sledging
expedition left the ship in the direction of Cape Columbia,
which was to be the base camp in the “dash”
for the goal of Peary’s ambition. This overland trip
consumed a fortnight, Cape Columbia being reached
on March 1st. Here the adventurers were 420 miles
from the North Pole in a straight line, and, with
parties to support him and leave food, the daring Peary
now started towards the top of the earth. In order to
get away from open water he had gone far westward
in the effort to avoid the usual eastward drift of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
polar ice and open water, which would defeat his
efforts.</p>

<p>At last he was off. Open leads&mdash;cracks in the ice
filled with water&mdash;delayed him greatly during the first
ten days of the expedition, so that by March the eleventh
the party had only reached the 84th. parallel. He
kept on, found the ice more even, and by the seventeenth,
had reached the eighty-sixth. On the twenty-third
of that month he outdistanced the best record of
a Norwegian, that of Nansen. Here his last supporting
party was sent back, the leader of which, Professor
Ross G. Marvin of Cornell University, lost his life by
drowning in an open lead, April the tenth.</p>

<p>The chosen few, gaunt, hollow-eyed, and energetic,
pressed towards their goal, and, on March the 24th.,
the best Italian record was distanced. On, on, they
crept over the ice-pack, the dogs trotting along briskly,
and pulling the little sledges slowly but surely towards
the apex of the earth. Living on pemmican (dried
meat, sugar, and raisins) and tea, the leader and his
companions kept up both their strength and their
spirits. On March 27th., the 87th. parallel was passed,
and on the 28th. Peary’s own record of “farthest
north” was distanced. The goal was near and confidence
increased with every mile of the advance.</p>

<p>When traveling in this region, heretofore, the gallant
explorer had been often hindered by leads of open
water and massive hummocks of ice. Fate was now
propitious and the ice seemed to be more flat and solid
than Peary had ever experienced before. On April
2nd., the 88th. parallel was crossed. Two days later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the 89th. parallel was left behind, and in two days
more, on April the sixth, the little party reached the
center of the northern hemisphere, and Commander
Peary stood at the North Pole. Hurray! Hurray!
The goal had been reached!</p>

<p>With the explorer were four trusted Eskimos and
the negro Henson, who had been with him on every
expedition. The Eskimos were Ooqueah, Ootah, Seeglo,
and Egingwah. Each of them placed a different
flag upon an ice cap at the uttermost end of the earth.
These were the banners of the Navy League, the D.
K. E. Fraternity, the Red Cross Flag, the D. A. R.
Peace Flag, and the flag of the United States carried
by the explorer for fifteen years. All cheered for the
Pole and for the flag, and then had a right merry feast
upon the very apex of the earth. No ice was needed
in the water which they drank!</p>

<p>The explorer had been so exhausted when he arrived
at the Pole that he had to seek a few hours’ sleep. Then
he arose and wrote the following words in his diary:</p>

<p>“The Pole at last. The prize of three centuries.
My dream and goal for twenty years. Mine at last!
I cannot bring myself to realize it. It seems all so
simple and commonplace!”</p>

<p>Yet, here he was, and he shook hands with all the
Eskimos, who seemed to be childishly pleased at the
feat which they had accomplished. Again they gave
“three times three,” with a vim, for the North Pole.</p>

<p>The Commander had good reason to be delighted, for,
as he says: “For more than a score of years that
point on the earth’s surface had been the object of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
every effort. To its attainment my whole being, physical,
mental and moral, had been dedicated. Many times
my own life and the lives of those with me had been
risked. My own material and forces and those of my
friends had been devoted to this object. This journey
was my eighth into the Arctic wilderness. In that
wilderness I had spent nearly twelve years out of the
twenty-three between my thirtieth and my fifty-third
year, and the intervening time spent in civilized communities
during that period had been mainly occupied
with preparations for returning to the wilderness.
The determination to reach the Pole had become so
much a part of my being, that, strange as it may seem,
I long ago ceased to think of myself, save as an instrument
for the attainment of that end. To the layman
this may seem strange, but an inventor can understand
it, or an artist, or any one who has devoted himself for
years upon years to the service of an idea.”</p>

<p>At about four o’clock on the afternoon of April 7th.,
the explorers turned their backs on the Pole, leaving
with a sense of sadness, for this was certainly a scene
which their “eye would never see again.” The journey
home was fraught with danger. Would they make
it?</p>

<p>The extraordinary speed which they had made in
reaching the Pole was exceeded in the journey home.
In sixteen days Cape Columbia had been reached, for
the dogs were good ones, and they averaged twenty-six
miles of travel a day. On April the 23rd., Peary entered
his “igloo,” or ice-house, at “Crane City,” Cape
Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>In one march of forty-five miles, Cape Hecla was
reached, and the <i>Roosevelt</i> in another of equal length.
The Commander’s heart thrilled, as, rounding the point
of the cape, he saw the little black ship lying there in
her icy berth, with her sturdy nose pointing straight
to the Pole. His dreadful trip was over and Victory
perched upon the masts of the intrepid vessel.</p>

<p>The ship was soon made ready for the homeward
voyage. In ten days’ time she was prepared to sail,
and, on July 18th., with only the tragic memory of the
lost and lamented Marvin to lessen the high spirits of
all, the <i>Roosevelt</i> pulled slowly out from the cape and
turned her nose again to the south. On September
25th., she steamed into Indian Harbor, in Labrador,
and the first dispatch went on the wires: “Have made
good at last, I have the Pole.”</p>

<p>Yet, much of the glory of Peary’s Arctic discovery
had been spoiled by Dr. Frederick A. Cook, an impostor,
who had come from the north, some months
before, had stated that he had reached the Pole, and
had spread the news broadcast over the civilized world.
Many had believed him, and he was given receptions,
balls, the freedom of cities, until his records were
found to be worthless and his story finally discredited.
His advent into the arena at this time was most unfortunate
for the gallant Peary, to whom belongs all
the glory and honor which is due a brave man who did
a big deed.</p>

<p>The <i>Roosevelt</i> at last reached the little town of Sydney,
Cape Breton, where Mrs. Peary and the children
were to meet the explorer. As the vessel neared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
city, the entire water-front was alive with people. The
seaport to which the adventurous navigator had returned
so many times, unsuccessful, gave him a royal
welcome as the <i>Roosevelt</i> steamed into view, flying at
her masthead a flag which had never before entered any
port in history,&mdash;the North Pole flag.</p>

<p>The success of the expedition was due to the experience,
the courage, endurance, and devotion of its members,
who put all that there was in them into the work;
and to the unswerving faith and loyalty of the Peary
Arctic Club, which furnished the funds without which
nothing could have been accomplished. Again, <span class="smcap">three
cheers for Peary!</span> He is a hero of whom all may be
proud.</p>

<p class="ppind p1">Yes, the Maid is a Maid of sorrow, her cheeks with tears are dim;</p>
<p class="ppind">For the skeletons of a thousand men she’s seen on the North Pole rim.</p>
<p class="ppind">As she prances on her snow white steed she beckons to stay away,</p>

<h2 class="p4">EPILOGUE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap03 p2">THE history of these adventurous men shows that
the human mind, ever curious and ever anxious
to discover new and unknown facts, will stimulate
the endeavors of staunch physical beings to do
feats of daring and energy which those of more contented
and passive mentality will never feel either
willing or able to accomplish.</p>

<p>Leif Ericson, Hudson, Pizarro, Peary, all were propelled
onward upon their missions of discovery and
of adventure by that curious spark of daring and love
of adventure which has stimulated a Roosevelt and a
Dillon Wallace.</p>

<p>It is the mind that drives onward the body; it is the
bump of curiosity which propels the adventurer to take
the risks and the hazards which are necessary for exploration
of unmapped countries.</p>

<p>Restless, dare-devilish souls will always exist, and,
now that there are no parts of the North American continent
which are unknown to the geographer and the
man of scientific bent, those who are prompted onward
by the spirit of hazardous adventure must search for
the unknown in the unmapped and untouched regions
of Africa or of South America. Here vast wildernesses
call to those of adventurous blood to come and to
admire; to struggle with the elements and to battle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the currents of their water-courses and the unmarked
trails of their mountains. But no treasure of the Montezumas,
nor gold of the Incas, lie where the restless
grasp of the invader can reach out and appropriate as
in the days of the dauntless Cortés and the avaricious
Pizarro.</p>

<p>So, live on! O Spirit of Adventure, without which
there would be no sparkle to life, no zest to the journey
into the wilderness, no tang to the canoe trip through
the unknown chain of lakes, or the beaver-dammed
water course. Live on! and may you ever exist in the
minds of young America, so that, when the great call
shall go up for those of Viking soul and De Soto daring
to rise and press onward for the honor of the flag,
there will be thousands of adventurers who have been
trained to the hazard of the camp, the slap of the
paddle, and the gleam of the rifle-barrel.</p>

<p>They, like the intrepid Peary, will “nail the good,
old flag” to the very ends of the earth, for it represents
“liberty, equality, fraternity”&mdash;three glorious qualities
for the maintenance of which every true-minded
boy, when he grows to be a man, will be willing to give
his time, his energy, and, if necessary&mdash;his life.</p>

friends to use at the twilight hour. They are not of the
soporific kind especially. They are wholesome reading
when most wide-awake and of such a soothing and delicious
flavor that they are welcome when the lights are
low.”&mdash;<i>Christian Intelligencer.</i></p>

<p>THE SANDMAN: <span class="smcap">His Fairy Stories</span>.</p>

<p>This time the Sandman comes in person, and takes
little Joyce, who believes in him, to the wonderful land
of Nod. There they procure pots and pans from the
pansy bed, a goose from the gooseberry bush, a chick
from the chickweed, corn from the cornflower, and eat
on a box from the boxwood hedge. They have almost
as many adventures as Alice in Wonderland.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
